<h1>Big John's Future Contact Page</h1>

<p>
If you're here, the reason is either because your browser is scripting-disabled
or you don't have an email client set up. I'm planning on putting a contact page
here to cover this eventuality, but it takes time. My philosophy of coding requires
me to understand all code that appears on PIE, and as of yet I've not gotten
the dynamic side of the site running. When that finally happens you will see
a glorious contact page that would make a mother proud. Until then, I apologize
and offer an obfuscated text representation of my email addy:
