<h1>Background Positioning vs. Centered Elements</h1>

<p>
Open this page in each of your installed browsers, and then drag the window widths
narrower and wider. See those little flickering lines on the end of the blue boxes?
They are a form of 1px error that may occur in any browser, but the errors manifest
differently from browser to browser.
</p>

</div>

<!-- First demo set -->
<div class="bg-holder-700">

    <div class="boxwidth-700">
    <p>This blue box has a specified width of <strong>700px</strong> and has side auto margins.</p>
    </div>

        <p class="bg-text">
        The grey boxes above and below are contained in a green-bordered DIV with no stated dimensions,
        and a dark colored <strong>700px&nbsp;background&nbsp;image</strong> is centered via background-positioning
        inside the red bordered parent DIV. The blue child boxes are
        given defined widths. The upper box has a width equal to the background image on the parent,
        while the lower box width is one pixel less. They are both centered within the
        green bordered parent via <strong>auto side margins</strong>.
        </p>

    <div class="boxwidth-699">
    <p>This blue box has a specified width of <strong>699px</strong> and has side auto margins.</p>
    </div>

</div>

<!-- Second demo set -->
<div class="bg-holder-699">

    <div class="boxwidth-699">
    <p>This blue box has a specified width of <strong>699px</strong> and has side auto margins.</p>
    </div>

        <p class="bg-text">
        This test has a <strong>699px background image</strong>, one pixel less wide than the 700px
        background image in the previous test. The two blue test boxes are also reduced by 1px
        in width from those in the previous test. This is done so that background images
        of both odd and even widths are tested. The blue boxes also come in two widths to
        provide odd/even testing for the auto margined block elements.
        </p>

    <div class="boxwidth-698">
    <p>This blue box has a specified width of <strong>698px</strong> and has side auto margins.</p>

<h2>Trying to Even the Odds</h2>

<p>
The above tests are designed to show what can happen in various browsers when an
element has a centered, vertically repeating background image, and also a nested
block element within
that is centered via its own &quot;auto&quot; side margins. You would think that
centering is just centering, but you would be wrong. If the container (or body
element perhaps) is as wide as the window, the computed width of the container box
might be almost any number of pixels. That pixel width will sometimes be odd, and sometimes even.
</p>

<p>
So when the browser is told to center a background image within that container, it
has to decide where the actual center lies. In the case of an odd total pixel width,
the browser must select one side or the other of the central odd pixel as the
&quot;center&quot; of the container. Then it has to find the center of the background
image, also fudging a bit if the BG's width is an odd number.
</p>

<p>
Obviously there is already lots of scope for variance between browsers when handling
this issue, but then suppose there is a width sized block element placed into that
container. Centering that box involves giving it side margins, both set to <strong>auto</strong>,
which are supposed to center it within its parent container.
</p>

<p>
So we have a background image, centered via the <strong>background-position</strong> property,
and the overlying box is centered via the <strong>margin</strong> property. In an
ideal world these two methods would behave the same regardless of the true width
of the container, but in fact they don't, and the ways they behave will vary in
each of the modern browsers. Each time you see one of those errors in the demos
(either as gaps or as box extensions beyond the BG to the left), it indicates that the centering
methods are not in sync with each other.
</p>

<h2>Comparing Browsers</h2>

<p>
A close examination of different browsers will show that each has a unique pattern to
their combined centering displays as the window width is varied. <strong>IEwin</strong>
is the one that has the problem when both the blue test box and the background image are the
same &quot;even&quot; pixel width, but if both are an &quot;odd&quot; width then it
is Firefox that gets it wrong! Opera only shows errors when the BG and test box are
opposite, one being even and the other odd.
</p>

<p>
There is <em>no</em> combination
of odd/even widths on background images and test boxes that will behave identically in
all browsers. If you can discover a combination that does work the same in all browsers,
we want to know about it.
</p>

<h2>Why This is a Problem</h2>

<p>
Typically a coder will have a centered wrapper element holding all the page content, and
then assign a centered background image to the body showing fades or dropshadows
that are meant to be aligned behind wrapper. Unfortunately these unsuspecting coders
don't realize that their paired (but separate and different) centering alignments
will be <em>misaligned for half of all possible window widths!</em>
</p>

<p>
If the cause is not understood, the BG will appear offset by 1px in 50% of all window displays.
And even if the coder happens to discover that dragging makes their BG do the &quot;Cha-cha,&quot;
their ever more frantic attempts to achieve cross-browser compliance can easily
lead to a mental breakdown.
</p>

<h2>Suppressing the Shimmy</h2>

<p>
There are two basic ways to solve this issue. One is to design the background image
so that the BG offset effect looks okay in either position. The other way is to
create a pair of nested wrappers, with the outer having a BG sized to exactly
match the width of the wrapper, and the inner wrapper serving as the &quot;content&quot;
wrapper.
</p>

<p>
In this case the outer wrapper would be slightly wider than the content-holding
inner wrapper, so that the outer wrapper may hold a BG image that will be visible
around the edges of the inner wrapper.
</p>

<p>
The outer wrapper is then itself centered via side auto margins,
while the inner wrapper is <em>not</em> centered at all. Instead, this
slightly narrower inner wrapper should be scooted over via a left pixel margin,
until it &quot;appears&quot; to be centered over the BG on the outer wrapper,
leaving just a little of that outer BG peeping around the edges of the inner wrapper.
</p>

<p>
Since no centering is applied to this inner wrapper or to the BG on the outer wrapper,
the misalignment cannot occur. Both wrappers act as a unit, and if they jiggle, they
do so together. Ain't that nice?
</p>

<p>
The width difference between the two wrappers is determined by how much background
image you wish to have show on either side of the inner wrapper.
</p>

<p>
Obviously all this applies <em>only</em> to rigidly sized wrappers, since a background image
cannot be liquid. However, the double wrapper trick can be extended to a third wrapper
so that left and right side dropshadow BG's could be placed behind the liquid wrapper,
each in a separate liquid wrapper DIV, but we'll save <em>that</em> for a future tutorial,
If we ever find time. Anyway, you now know how to avoid getting the dreaded
&quot;bi-polar page disorder&quot;, and do spread the word, okay?
