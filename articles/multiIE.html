Most of the improvements in conditional comments talked about in this article
have now been incorporated into an easy-to-install set of IE standalone versions
available at
<a href="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE">Tredosoft.com</a>. We recommend
this install very highly, so enjoy!

Multiple versions of Explorer for Windows on a single computer have revolutionized
CSS bug testing for websites, but sadly the different IE browser windows appear
identical to the eye, potentially leading to confusion and testing mistakes. Also,
Microsoft's proprietary <strong>Conditional&nbsp;Comments</strong>
don't operate properly on these standalones, making advanced usage of CC's a guessing game.
These problems have now been resolved! But first, a little background regarding the standalones.
</p>

<h2>What Are These Standalones?</h2>

<p>
When <strong>Joe Maddalone</strong> first came up with
<a href="http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/33150">
Multiple Version of IE in Windows XP Pro</a> in November 2003, this was a great
relief for web developers. Technically speaking, it was made possible by using a
system feature which may be functionally described as a <strong>process specific
subroutine library</strong>, for otherwise system wide shared .dll and .com modules. It is
supported by the system scheduler from Win98 SE onwards and is triggered by an
empty file with the name <strong>process.exe.local</strong>.
</p>

<p>
For Windows to allow several Explorer versions running side by side on one machine,
this process specific subroutine library, in short
<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;process library&nbsp;</span>,
must contain the <strong>starting module</strong>
for the process (iexplore.exe), the <strong>trigger</strong> (iexplore.exe.local),
and any required process specific dll's. For more details, see Joe Maddalone's
consolidated info: <a href="http://labs.insert-title.com/labs/?ID=795">Multiple
IEs in Windows</a>.
</p>

<p>
Get the conveniently prepared standalones themselves
<a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/?ie/32bit/standalone">here</a>.
</p>

<p class="tip">
<strong>Multiple Standalone Installer Now Availible!</strong> (Oct '06) &nbsp;
We no longer must manually install and modify the IE Standalones, because
<strong>Yousif&nbsp;Al&nbsp;Saif</strong> of <a href="http://tredosoft.com/">tredosoft.com</a>
has compiled IE3 thru IE6, along with all title markers and registry fixes, into
a single easy installer package. It even comes with special files to keep PNG
scripts working in IE6 for proper testing. Wow. Install IE7 from MS first, then go
<a href="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE">here</a> for instructions.
Way to go, Yousif!</p>

<h3>What took so long?</h3>

<p>
One question bothers me: If Win98 SE (and the feature in question) was available
as early as April 1999, why did the feature I refer to as the
<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;process library&nbsp;</span>
took more than 4 years to surface? In my opinion, it's partially because the Windows OS
is lacking any concise description, and also because Microsoft seems to have obscured it
by using at least three different names to designate this feature:
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/msi/setup/isolated_components.asp">
Isolated Components</a>,
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/sbscs/setup/dll_com_redirection_on_windows.asp">
DLL/COM Redirection</a>, and
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnsetup/html/dlldanger1.asp">
Side-by-side approach for implementing private DLLs</a>.
</p>

<p>
The last one is to be found in <em>The End of DLL Hell</em> (<strong>Rick Anderson</strong>,
Microsoft, January 2000). Anderson also mentions "using a unique version number" for
implementing private DLLs, a different approach which was called later on
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnsetup/html/sidebyside.asp">
Side-by-side Component Sharing</a>, contributing still further to the confusion!
</p>

<p>
Anyway, we now have standalones for each version of Explorer back to version 4, and that's
great, but they can be made even better.
</p>

<h2>Perfecting The Standalones</h2>

<p>
To enhance the usability of multiple IE's further, I would like to demonstrate 3 changes
for versions IE 5.01, IE 5.5, and IE 6:
</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Enable processing Cookies with your IE Standalones</em></li>
<li><em>Add the IE version number to the title bar of the Standalone browser window
(also for IE 4.01)</em></li>
<li><em>Finally get Conditional Comments working in the IE Standalones</em></li>
</ol>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>
Although this is the simplest of the three modifications here, it took a long time to surface.
To the best of my knowledge it was <strong>M. Cain</strong>, who in May 2005 proposed
it for the first time and it was brought to my attention by <strong>David Wilson</strong>
only recently. It is done by adding a backlevel module to each
<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;process library&nbsp;</span>.
</p>

<p>
First download the file 3725.exe from Microsoft. You will find the page easily by searching
for its FamilyID which is "6DEE32AB-B618-4FB3-9A45-CDD08162E167". The file
description denotes it as "Win32 Cabinet Self-Extractor", but it should not (and will not apply
anyway) be applied to your system.
</p>

<p>
Instead use WinZip (or an equivalent tool) and it will show you 7 files which are contained in
3725.exe. From these choose Wininet.dll to be extracted and put it into the folders of your IE
standalones. This very same Wininet.dll (version 5.0.2614.3400, date April 14, 1999) applies
to all of the standalones.
</p>

<p>
That's it - enjoy testing with cookies!
</p>

<h3>Version Labels</h3>

<p>
To achieve Modification #2 two things have to be done:<br />
1. checking and possibly changing a registry string, and<br />
2. adding a modified module to each <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;process library&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
If the registry string in question, <strong>Window Title</strong>, exists in your registry,
it will cause <strong>all</strong> your different Internet Explorer versions to display
the same character string on the title bar. This character string comes from the
<strong>Window Title</strong> string and its default value is, you guessed it,
"Microsoft Internet Explorer". For some background information you may want to read
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/176497/EN-US/">
How to Change the Internet Explorer Window Title</a> on the Microsoft site.
</p>

<p>
In order to check for the <strong>Window Title</strong> string's existence, click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, click <strong>Run</strong>, and type in "regedit.exe".
This launches the registry editor, where you may then navigate to the <strong>Main</strong>
key. It will be found under <strong>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\</strong>
where "HKCU" may be read as "HKEY_CURRENT_USER".
</p>

<p>
Once in <strong>Main</strong>, look carefully for a string called <strong>Window
Title</strong>, and if there is one, right click it, and rename it to <strong>zWindow
Title</strong>.
</p>

<p>
To enable the Version Labels for your <strong>IE 4.01</strong> Standalone (for the
hint I wish to thank Derek Ahmedzai), the procedure is very similar. This time you start with
<strong>"HKLM"</strong>, which means "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE", go for
<strong>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main</strong> and again look for
the <strong>Window Title</strong> string.
</p>

<p>
If there is none,  right click <strong>Main</strong>, select "New", choose "String Value"
for the data type, and rename the resulting "New Value #1" to <strong>Window Title</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Now you have a <strong>Window Title</strong> string anyway, right click it, and select
"Modify". When the "Edit String" menue pops up, you can set the value data to "IE 4.01
(Microsoft Internet Explorer)" and click "OK". That's all you need for IE 4.01 !
</p>

<p class="tip">
Follow these instructions exactly to the letter, as for sure, the Registry Database is not
designed for the "trial and error" approach. If you would like to change something on your
own, you should at least have read and understood the
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/256986/EN-US/">
Description of the Microsoft Windows registry</a> beforehand.
</p>

<p>
To finally enable the Version Labels for your <strong>IE 5.01</strong>, <strong>IE 5.5</strong>, and <strong>IE 6.0</strong>
Standalone, it is also necessary to add a specially modified module (BROWSELC.DLL) to the
<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;process library&nbsp;</span>. The modification consists
in replacing the string "Microsoft Internet Explorer" (which appears in the title bar) by "IE 5.01
(Microsoft Internet Explorer)", "IE 5.5 (Microsoft Internet Explorer)" and "IE 6.0 (Microsoft
Internet Explorer)" respectively. Once those .DLL's are in place, the browser window top bar
will proudly announce what IE version it is, dispelling all confusion.
</p>

<p class="tip">
The discussion assumes you have IE 7 as your primary or native browser and IE 6 is a
Standalone version. Should you have IE 6 as the primary Explorer browser, leave it
untouched, the lack of a version label in the title bar will indicate that it is IE 6 anyway.
</p>

<p>
To download the .DLL's, right click the links below, select "Save target as", and save into the folder
that contains the <strong>IEXPLORE.EXE</strong> file for each of the standalones.
In other words, those .DLL's are each specific to either IE 5.01, IE 5.5 or IE 6.0, and each must
share the same folder with the primary .EXE file for each standalone browser version. All three
DLL's have the <em>same name</em> (BROWSELC.DLL), so don't put them in the same
folder at any time!
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="sidepages/ie5/BROWSELC.DLL">Explorer 5.01</a></li>
<li><a href="sidepages/ie55/BROWSELC.DLL">Explorer 5.5</a></li>
<li><a href="sidepages/ie6/BROWSELC.DLL">Explorer 6.0</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Repairing Conditional Comments</h3>

<p>
For details on the subject, go straight to the source and read
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/overview/ccomment_ovw.asp">About
Conditional Comments</a> on the Microsoft site. Some say that using this proprietary feature is
a bad practice because CC's are non-standard, but basically it's just code that has been stuffed
within an HTML comment, a comment internally labeled so that various IE versions may reach into
that comment and pull out parsable code.  If all browsers had something similar, bug fixing would
be a whole lot more feasable in Opera and Mozilla.
</p>

<p>
Further, CC's do validate because to the validator and non-IE/Win browsers, a CC looks like a
normal HTML comment and thus is ignored.
</p>

<p>
Most of the conditional comment behaviors may be restored to the standalones by performing
a simple one time edit to your registry. It consists only of renaming a particular key,
which currently says <strong>IE</strong>, so that it says <strong>zIE</strong>.
</p>

<p>
To do this, click the <strong>Start</strong> button, click <strong>Run</strong>, and
type in "regedit.exe". This launches the registry editor, where you may then navigate to
the desired registry key. The target key, called <strong>IE</strong>, may be found under
<strong>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Version Vector\</strong>.
In some Windows versions the "HKLM" may appear as "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE"
</p>

<p>
Once in <strong>Version Vector</strong>, look for the key called <strong>IE</strong>,
right click it, and rename it to <strong>zIE</strong>.
</p>

<p>
(If you are running a 64-bit version of Windows, I would like to get in touch with you,
to figure out the correct procedure for changing the key. A "registry reflector" copies
values forth and back between the above mentioned key and
<strong>HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Version Vector\</strong>,
which is used for 32-bit applications running on a 64-bit machine).
</p>

<p>
The next time Internet Explorer is started, the missing <strong>IE</strong> key will
cause it to fetch needed information from other modules, where at least 4 slightly different
character strings (containing version, subversion, build etc.) are available. The information
found there will enable the standalones to function almost perfectly when presented with
Conditional Comments. If you want to restore your OS to the previous registry state and
browser behavior, simply rename the <strong>zIE</strong> key back to <strong>IE</strong>
and restart Internet Explorer.
</p>

<p class="tip">
If you have never altered your registry before, be assured it is not dangerous, <em>provided you
follow these instructions exactly to the letter!</em>. But, should you allow temptation to take
control, and you rashly make other edits, Neither I nor Position Is Everything are responsible for
what might happen!
</p>

<h3>Verifying the Regained CC Functionality</h3>

<p>
With the four different Internet Explorers (IE 5.01, IE 5.5, IE 6 and IE 7.0) we have a total of 27
different expressions (plus 22 negations) that may be used within a Conditional Comment, all of
which will work reliably after the registry modification. These "expressions" within the Conditional
Comments normally determine which Explorer versions will look inside the CC for parsable code.
It is this functionality you have just restored.
</p>

<p>
To test your registry edit for correct behavior, <a href="sidepages/cond_1.html">run a test</a> using
the Internet Explorer of your choice, and you will get either true or false for each of the 27 CC
expressions. The <span class="true">true</span>/<span class="false">false</span> patterns from
these tests (simplified screenshots) are what you will see on the live test page.
</p>

<p class="float-p">
<img id="70b" src="images/ie70.png" alt="Expected screenshot from testing CC's with IE 7.0" />
If you install IE 7, this is the pattern what you should see for it and also for all your
IE Standalone browsers if you haven't applied the registry change. Thus to be able to
tailor unique styles <em>for all your IE versions</em>, you have to make the registry
change.
</p>

<p class="float-p-r">
<img src="images/ie60.png" alt="Screenshot from testing CC's with IE 6" /> This
shows the pattern from the test with IE 6: if you have installed IE 7, you will get
this only after the registry change. - But in case you don't have IE 7, this will be the picture
for all your IE versions, and again it is vital to edit the registry for applying unique styles
to them.
</p>

<p class="float-p">
<img src="images/ie55.png" alt="Screenshot from testing CC's with IE 5.5" />
All of the results from the IE 5.5 Standalone are now correct, thanks to a valuable hint
from Thierry Koblentz at <a href="http://www.tjkdesign.com/">TJKDesign</a>:
simply replace "IE 5.5" by "IE 5.5000" in the expressions and it works!
</p>

<p class="float-p-r">
<img src="images/ie50.png" alt="Screenshot from testing CC's with IE 5.01" />
The registry change restores the correct results from IE 5.01.
</p>

<h3 style="padding-top: 20px;" class="clear">A technical Discussion About CC's</h3>

<p>
When you start up an Internet Explorer 5+, it goes to the registry and reads all of the
<strong>Version Vector</strong> into an array to keep it in memory. This is done
only once at the time of initialisation. If IE later on encounters the characters
"<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;&lt;!--[if&nbsp;</span>" while processing a
web-page, it recognizes a so-called <strong>downlevel-hidden CC</strong> (the
term "downlevel" was coined by MS in the times of the "browser wars" and denotes any
non-MS browser as well as IE 4 and earlier). It will take the character string
<strong>IE</strong> (or whatever you wrote instead) from the CC and search the
Version Vector array for a match (not case sensitive). For example, if you code:
</p>

<p class="code">
&lt;!--[if zIE]> ... &lt;![endif]--><br />
&lt;!--[if zIE 6.0]> ... &lt;![endif]--><br />
</p>

<p>
the result will be "true" in both cases, independent from the version of IE you
run, if you followed the procedure above to the letter, "false" otherwise. But you
could easily have substituted your name rather than <strong>zIE</strong> to create a
personalized Conditional Comment!
</p>

<p>
The point of changing the registry key IE to zIE is simply that if the Internet Explorer does
<em>not</em> find the <strong>IE</strong> key in the <strong>Version Vector</strong>,
then it creates such an entry in the version vector array by using version information from the
modules as a substitute, such enabling the use of CC's.
</p>

<h3 class="clear">More on CC's: the Ugly ones</h3>

<p>
Apart from the dowlevel-hidden CC's, which many people find awful anyway, MS also
invented the <strong>downlevel-revealed Conditional Comment</strong>:
<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;&lt;![if IE]>&nbsp;</span> ...
<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;&lt;![endif]>&nbsp;</span>. It does not only
look ugly, it doesn't even validate! I would not have mentioned it here, if not
<a href="http://www.emological.com/">John Lascurettes</a> came up with a solution,
where he used a downlevel-revealed CC <em>inside</em> a downlevel-hidden one.
</p>

<p>
This construct <strong>validates</strong> and enables us, to select certain combinations
of IE's for which there is no solution with a single downlevel-hidden CC (see "Selecting IE's"
below). But the solution is much more powerful, when considered in detail. Most importantly,
you can hide html from any or from a selection of IE's. For example
</p>
<p class="code">&lt;!--[if IE]>&lt;![if gt IE 6]>&lt;![endif]--><br />
<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span><br />
&lt;!--[if IE]>&lt;![endif]>&lt;![endif]--></p>
<p>
The <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span> here will be selected by any
browser <em>except</em> IE 6, IE 5.5 and IE 5.01. In this group you will find all
browsers (including IE 7 and IE 5.2) which are capable of processing advanced css selectors.
Furthermore, even the <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span> is inside a
downlevel-revealed CC, it is truly html (so it may contain comments) and not just a funny
looking comment. In other words, the non-standard area is restricted to contain only the
selection mechanism for IE, but no html.
</p>

<p>
For a working webpage we would like to complement the above by a more familiar
looking downlevel-hidden CC, selecting IE 6, IE 5.5 and IE 5.01
</p>
<p class="code">&lt;!--[if lte IE 6]><span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span>&lt;![endif]--></p>

<h3 class="clear">Producing CC's with XSLT</h3>

<p>
If you want to apply a <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;browser-side&nbsp;</span>
transformation to insert CC's into your <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span>,
then the first part of the example given above can be directly translated into XSLT:
<p class="code">&lt;xsl:comment>&lt;![CDATA[[if IE]>&lt;![if gt IE 6]>&lt;![endif]]]>&lt;/xsl:comment><br />
<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span><br />
&lt;xsl:comment>&lt;![CDATA[[if IE]>&lt;![endif]>&lt;![endif]]]>&lt;/xsl:comment></p>
</p>

<p>
Here <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span> may be any valid
XSLT including literal result elements and even comments! Now the second part
can be constructed along the same lines, because XSLT supports the
<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;system-property&nbsp;</span> function. So we again
use a downlevel-revealed inside a downlevel-hidden CC, wrapped in a XSLT
<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;if-clause&nbsp;</span>.
<p class="code">&lt;xsl:if test="system-property('xsl:vendor') = 'Microsoft'"><br />
&lt;xsl:comment>&lt;![CDATA[[if IE]>&lt;![if lte IE 6]>&lt;![endif]]]>&lt;/xsl:comment><br />
<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span><br />
&lt;xsl:comment>&lt;![CDATA[[if IE]>&lt;![endif]>&lt;![endif]]]>&lt;/xsl:comment><br />
&lt;/xsl:if></p>
</p>

<p>
In case the CC's are inserted with <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;server-side&nbsp;</span>
XSLT, the first part remains unchanged. But the second part changes, because in
absence of the <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;system-property&nbsp;</span> function
we have to accept a html look alike or pseudo-html:
<p class="code">&lt;xsl:comment>&lt;![CDATA[[if lte IE 6]><br />
<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;pseudo-html&nbsp;</span><br />
&lt;![endif]]]>&lt;/xsl:comment></p>
</p>

<h3 class="clear">Selecting IE's</h3>

<p>
Finaly we can select any of the 16 different combinations of the four Internet Explorers,
ranging from none to all. Some of the expressions are called <strong>less specific</strong>
here, because they will also select future browsers with versions greater than 7.0.
</p>

<p>
The following terms are defined as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>gt = selects greater than</li>
<li>lt = selects less than</li>
<li>gte = selects greater than or equal to</li>
<li>lte = selects less than or equal to</li>
<li>! = selects everything <em>except</em> what directly follows the "!"
   (the "!" character must be placed directly before the beginning of
   the CC term value, and is not obeyed if it appears elswhere in the term.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To specify which versions will read the CC, the following arrangements may be employed:
</p>

<ol>
<li>To select exclusivly for any <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;non IE&nbsp;</span>
   - use "<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;IE&nbsp; &amp; !IE&nbsp;</span>"
   for a downlevel-revealed within a downlevel-hidden CC
   <p class="code">&lt;!--[if IE]>&lt;![if !IE]>&lt;![endif]--> <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span> &lt;!--[if IE]>&lt;![endif]>&lt;![endif]--></p></li>
<li>To select for <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;IE 5.01 only&nbsp;</span>
   - use "<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;IE 5.0&nbsp;</span>" or
   "lte IE 5.0" or "!gt IE 5.0" or "lt IE 5.5000" or "!gte IE 5.5000"
   <p class="code">&lt;!--[if IE 5.0]> <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span> &lt;![endif]--></p></li>
<li>To select for <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;IE 5.5 or 6 or 7.0&nbsp;</span>
   - use "<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;!IE 5.0&nbsp;</span>" or
   "!lte IE 5.0" or "gt IE 5.0" or "!lt IE 5.5000" or "gte IE 5.5000" (all less specific)
   <p class="code">&lt;!--[if !IE 5.0]> <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span> &lt;![endif]--></p></li>
<li>To select for <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;IE 5.5 only&nbsp;</span>
   - use "<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;IE 5.5000&nbsp;</span>"
   <p class="code">&lt;!--[if IE 5.5000]> <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span> &lt;![endif]--></p></li>
<li>To select for <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;IE 5.01 or 6 or 7.0&nbsp;</span>
   - use "<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;!IE 5.5000&nbsp;</span>" (less specific)
   <p class="code">&lt;!--[if !IE 5.5000]> <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span> &lt;![endif]--></p></li>
<li>To select for <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;IE 6 only&nbsp;</span>
   - use "<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;IE 6&nbsp;</span>"
   <p class="code">&lt;!--[if IE 6]> <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span> &lt;![endif]--></p></li>
<li>To select for <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;IE 5.01 or 5.5 or 7.0&nbsp;</span>
   - use "<span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;!IE 6&nbsp;</span>" (less specific)
   <p class="code">&lt;!--[if !IE 6]> <span class="inlineimp">&nbsp;html&nbsp;</span> &lt;![endif]--></p></li>

You may have noticed the symmetry between (2) and (3), and also between (6) and (7):
The expressions for the former are negated for the later. Even more redundancy can
be seen, because "gt xx" converts directly to "!lte xx", and "lt xx" converts directly
to "!gte xx".
