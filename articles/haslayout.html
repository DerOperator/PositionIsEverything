This page explains how to feed specially prepared CSS to Internet Explorer, primarily
to supply the "zoom&nbsp;fix" and confer
<a href="http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html"><strong>hasLayout</strong></a>
on an element. Making Internet&nbsp;Explorer think a certain box "has&nbsp;layout" can correct
most of the float-induced or list-related bugs found in that browser. This fix cannot be used globally
on all elements without causing major difficulties, but proper application of the fix is <em>vital</em>
if you want to do any really advanced CSS layouts, particularly if floats are used.
</p>

<p>
Primarily we need to apply such fixes just so we can use floats and list elements without
major bug problems. Finding the elements that need the fix is a matter of trial and error
for the most part. Simply move the fix to different suspect elements until the bug goes away
(if you're lucky!). There is a method to IE's madness, but the details are invoved and ultimately
useless. Experimenting with the zoom fix is fast and usually effective. After using the fix on a few
pages you'll get a feel for the kind of elements that might benefit from hasLayout.
</p>

<p>
Besides doing hasLayout fixes, we might also need to feed special
scripts to IE6 and lower for PNG support or any-element hovering, and possibly for modified
width or height values on some boxes for the benefit of IE5.5 and lower only, due to the different
way those old IE browsers handle CSS boxes when borders or paddings are used on the boxes.
</p>

<p>
In order for the method to succeed, it's <em>essential</em> that it be employed on pages displaying in
"<a href="http://www.communitymx.com/content/article.cfm?cid=85FEE">standards&nbsp;mode</a>."
This is because a browser running in "quirks&nbsp;mode" will display the same way decade-old
browsers once did, to comply with backwards-compatibility for very old web pages.
</p>

<p>
Besides the mode issue, it's important that you create your CSS layouts in a modern non-IE browser,
and then attempt to correct any issues that IE may have with your standards-based code. Do NOT
build sites while checking only in IE, or its many bugs and incorrect behaviors will lead to bad code
and many difficulties in other browsers.
</p>

<h2>Feed your Head</h2>

<p>
Place the following code block in the head section of every page to be IE-corrected. Be careful to
have this code block following the primary CSS file or calling link (the one that's read by all browsers),
or else the new IE-only rules may not be able to override the relevant main CSS rules.
For more info on the subject, see the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#specificity">specificity&nbsp;section</a>
in the W3C specs.

You can change the link calls or add more, but don't mess with the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/overview/ccomment_ovw.asp">Conditional&nbsp;Comments</a>
unless you know what you're doing.
</p>

<h3>Using the CC's</h3>

<p class="clear">
The first CC feeds <strong>myiehacks.css</strong> to all versions of IE.
This file is used mainly to give any
<a href="http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html"><strong>hasLayout</strong></a>
fixing required for IE6. IE7 does have some
remaining bugs that require such fixing, but even if a given hasLayout bug occurs only in IE6
and below the fix will not harm IE7 and so does not need to be hidden from IE7. Versions before
IE5.5 generally have the same hasLayout bugs as IE6.
</p>

<p>
Generally this file will contain a "zoom" rule, shown below with examples of elements to be given
hasLayout. The zoom property is one of those that triggers hasLayout on a box in IE, but the
value "1" is equal to 100% of zoom so no zooming actually occurs. Only the hasLayout triggering
takes place.
</p>

<code>.somebuggyelement,
.somebuggyelement a,
.colwrapper div {
  zoom: 1;
  }
</code>

<p>
Whenever you discover an element that needs the fix for IE, just add it to the multiple selector,
making sure to separate it from the other selectors by a comma. Note: don't use a comma after the
last selector or strict browsers will properly ignore the entire rule!
</p>

<p>
The second CC targets IE6 and below for any scripting calls such as the Suckerfish script
or the various PNG support scripts. These scripts force IE6 to emulate support for any-element
CSS hovering and semi-transparent PNG images. IE7 natively supports both those things,
thus IE7 need not see (and be slowed by) any such scripts unnecessarily.
</p>

<p>
The third CC is targeted to IE5.5 and lower only.
<strong>myiehacks-5.5.css</strong> will contain any widths or heights for boxes
that don't display correctly due to the
<a href="http://www.communitymx.com/content/article.cfm?cid=E0989953B6F20B41">Box&nbsp;Model&nbsp;Problem</a>.
If you do not wish to support IE5.5 in this way you can simply delete the last conditional comment completely along with its link.
</p>

<p>
 Be aware that IE5/Win does not support zoom and so can't be fixed by this method. If you must support
 that browser, you can make a duplicate of the zoom rule within the last CC and change "zoom:&nbsp;1;"
 to "height:&nbsp;1%;". This rule will harmlessly trigger hasLayout in IE5/Win, but it must <em>not</em>
 be read by IE7 (or any other modern browser) or else big problems will occur.
</p>

<p class="tip">
BTW, these CCs are bulletproof and immune to any future IE
browser changes. They will always perform exactly as advertised,
because they're a proprietary Microsoft feature, not some browser
flaw to be exploited.
