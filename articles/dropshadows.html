This article is largely obsolete due to an
<a href="dropshadows2.html">improved&nbsp;method</a> that covers all sides of a box and needs
only one shadow image to work. However, some may prefer this method or have already implemented
it, so this article will remain for the time being.

graphics editor. Enjoy!
</p>

<p>
This article will describe a modification to existing drop shadow methods, employing
semi-transparent .png's. Therefore the method is meant for use in in IE7 and
the other modern browsers, but <em>not</em> in IE6 and below, which do not correctly display
such .png's. IE/Mac can display .png's correctly but will have trouble with the
CSS used in the method. We have a
<a href="sidepages/dropshadow/dropshadow.html">minimal&nbsp;demo&nbsp;page</a>
available, complete with helpful tips in the source comments.
</p>

<h2>Browser Support</h2>

<p>
The PNG Drop Shadow method works in Gecko browsers, Opera, Safari, and IE7. It is made to degrade
gracefully to a basic box without dropshadows in earlier IE versions, since those
browsers don't support the partially transparent .png's used in the method.
<strong>IE/Mac</strong> does <em>not support the method at all</em>, due to the lack of
widths on some floated or positioned elements, and also because of the relative
shifting effects used. The
<a href="http://www.sam-i-am.com/work/sandbox/css/mac_ie5_hack.html">IE&nbsp;Machack</a>
may be used to dumb down the code in a way similar to the IE6 dumb-down technique.
</p>

<h2>What Has Gone Before</h2>

<p>
Say what you want about drop shadows, they are everywhere on the web and in print,
and for good reason. There's just no other way to get a three-dimensional effect
without making page elements physically move around. Such shadows might be placed on any
sides of a box, but the common usage is to have them on the right and bottom edges,
and we will confine ourselves to that convention.
</p>

<p>
There have been a lot of methods developed to display drop shadows, and all the
early ones made use of tables. These days it's usually considered bad practice to
use tables for "window-dressing" of this kind, and so
<a href="http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=DropShadows">tableless&nbsp;methods</a>
have been developed to do the same thing. Unfortunately, all current drop shadow
methods tend to have undesirable side-effects and/or display weaknesses of one kind
or another.
</p>

<p>
Let's quickly review the existing methods, or you can just
<a href="#method">skip to the new method</a>.
</p>

<h3>Pure CSS</h3>

<p>
It's possible to use nested DIV's and simple background colors to fake the look
of drop shadows, as long as you just want to <em>suggest</em> a drop shadow.
<a href="http://phoenity.com/newtedge/drop_shadow/">Phoenity.com</a> offers a method using
backgrounds on several nested DIV's, along with two trickier methods.
</p>

<p>
Essentially the background method starts with some DIV's nested together and being all the same size.
Then beginning with the outer DIV, each successive child DIV is given a progressively
darker background, and relative positioning allows them to be shifted up and to
the left by 1px more for each successive DIV. This creates a content box that is
backed by other boxes of the same size, each one a bit farther down and to the
right than the one in front of it, simulating a drop shadow. Very simple indeed.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, clients are high-maintainance creatures, and they usually require that
drop shadows be "fuzzy." Oh sure, real shadows usually <em>are</em> fuzzy, but clients
could be more reasonable, yes? Well, <em>no</em>, clients seem to have <em>all the
money</em>, and the money is saying "fuzzy" too, so we had better listen to the
money, yes?
</p>

<h3>Using Images</h3>

<p>
The obvious solution is to go with images of some kind, and that's where it starts to
get complicated. First the fuzzy drop shadow images must be <em>made</em>, requiring graphic
skills. We can't help you there, but assuming you can get by that hurdle, next
comes trying to arrange code so the image or images end up looking drop-shadow-like.
</p>

<p>
Of course you may always add a customized dropshadow to any existing image using
a graphics program, and also create one separately for use in a padded DIV that contains
some content, but this will not work when a site is pulling arbitrary content out
of a database.
</p>

<p>
Thus <strong>Requirement Number One:</strong> <em>The ideal drop shadow method
must work on any arbitrary element</em>.
</p>

<p>
This requirement has been met in the past by using a table, with cells that contain
the important corner bits of the shadow while the long cells along the right and
bottom sides are allowed to stretch out the fuzzy image to any needed length.
However this kind of table trickery is really bad practice, due to major accessibility
issues and also because of code complexity. We will assume that you don't want to go there.
</p>

<p>
CSS doesn't utilize table cells, but it does have <strong>backgrounds</strong>, and these will be our
primary tools for creating drop shadows. We've already seen how simple background-colored
DIV's can get the job done, and backgrounds are not limited to colors but may
also accept <strong>images</strong>. Furthermore, CSS allows backgrounds to be
<strong>positioned</strong> against any of the four sides
of a designated box. Cool, that's just what we need for drop shadows!
</p>

<p class="tip">
The imaged drop shadow approach does have a serious problem, and that's
<em>file&nbsp;size</em>. Using pure CSS for a drop shadow may not look great, but
the server hit is very small. So what exactly <em>is</em> the bandwidth cost of
using images? Well, the main
<a href="sidepages/dropshadow/shadow.png"><strong>shadow.png</strong></a>
image used in our
<a href="sidepages/dropshadow/dropshadow.html">demo&nbsp;page</a> is
only 3.5kb, while its dimensions are a quite-large 800x600 pixels. The file weight
is this small because most of the area in shadow.png consists of <em>simple transparency</em>.
The two corner .png's used are just 275 bytes each
(<a href="sidepages/dropshadow/upperrightfade.png"><strong>upperrightfade.png</strong></a> and
<a href="sidepages/dropshadow/lowerleftfade.png"><strong>lowerleftfade.png</strong></a>),
so all three images together sum to just <strong>4kb</strong> total. A typical web page .jpg is
<em>far</em> more than a mere 4kb. Since this drop shadow method re-uses these .png's for every
instance on a site, that 4kb is a one-time hit and will then be <em>cached</em>, requiring no
further bandwidth expense.
</p>

<h4>Earlier Imaged Drop Shadow Methods</h4>

<p>
Way back in 2003, <strong>Dunstan Orchard</strong> explained his
<a href="http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2003/11/14/shadows/">Easy&nbsp;CSS&nbsp;drop&nbsp;shadows</a>
method, later reprised and improved at <strong>A&nbsp;List&nbsp;Apart</strong>
by <strong>Sergio&nbsp;Villarreal</strong> in the
<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssdropshadows/">CSS&nbsp;Drop&nbsp;Shadows</a>
article. Dunstan's method uses a drop shadow that is very wide and tall (we're
doing the same thing), and positions that background into the lower right corner
of a box. Any parts of the background that would display beyond the edges of the
parent box are automatically clipped off visually. Then an
inner nested element is shifted up and to the left via negative margins, allowing
the background on the parent to show.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, the place where the background is clipped looks very sharp and not at all
fuzzy, potientially making a client unhappy. Sergio soon had this pointed out to him,
so he then went beyond Dunstan with the
<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssdrop2/">CSS&nbsp;Drop&nbsp;Shadows&nbsp;II:&nbsp;Fuzzy&nbsp;Shadows</a>
article, where Sergio shows a neat method of applying a masking background to the main image
via one extra nested DIV. It works by having the image start pure white (or the color
of the page background) along the top and left edges, and that white then quickly
fades to transparency just a short distance from those edges. Most of this .png
image is blocked off by the opaque content box, leaving just a bit showing.
Those two bits that show in the upper right and lower left corners will then
partially mask the main shadow image where it is cut off, giving the appearance
of a nice end-fade.
</p>

<p>
Because of that opaque white portion of the masking .png,
the method <em>must</em> be placed in front of a solid white page background, or
some other color that will serve in place of the white in the masking
.png image.
</p>

<p>
Then along came <strong>Brian Williams'</strong>
<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/onionskin/">Onion&nbsp;Skinned&nbsp;Drop&nbsp;Shadows</a>,
which uses two DIV's instead of one to mask the corners, allowing a simpler way to offest
the content box, and thus allowing a slight lessening of the shadow thickness merely
by adjusting the CSS rules.
</p>

<p>
Those are great methods, but they have one really serious flaw, in that these masking
backgrounds must overlie the main drop shadow background image. You may be saying,
"What of it?", and in
the case of a <strong>.jpg</strong> or <strong>.gif</strong> image, you are right
to ask. Those image formats work fine with this method. But there is another
format, <strong>.png</strong>, and it is much more effective for drop shadows than
either .jpg or .gif can ever be.
</p>

<h3>Why PNG Is Better</h3>

<p>
In a <strong>.jpg</strong>, all displayed pixels must be fully opaque, meaning
you can't see thru them. In the <strong>.gif</strong> format, all pixels may be
fully opaque or fully transparent, so you may either see thru a pixel completely
or not at all. That's fine if you know what solid color the shadow will be cast upon,
because the shadow image may then be faded to that color and it will look great.
</p>

<p>
Now think about our ideal drop shadow. It's supposed to be a <em>shadow</em>,
right? When you see a real shadow caused by one object fall across other objects,
can't you still see those other objects, even if they are darkened? Sure, and that
is where the non-png formats fall down. <strong>They don't allow you to look thru the
shadow</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>.png</strong> format does allow this, because a pixel may be set to
any transparency from 0% to 100%. So our ideal shadow image may start at the outer
edge at fully transparent, and gradually become more colored and less transparent
as it gets closer to the object that is supposedly casting the shadow.
</p>

<p>
Thus <strong>Requirement Number Two:</strong> <em>The ideal drop shadow method must use the .png format</em>.
</p>

<h3>One Little Problem</h3>

<p>
Okay, you know the drill by now, it's.. (<em>drum&nbsp;roll..</em>)
<strong>IE6&nbsp;</strong>. <em>Again!</em> (sigh)&nbsp; IE just
does <em>not</em> support the png format when partial transparency is used. It's
been a web-scandal for years, given that most all competing browsers started supporting .png
long ago. Happily <strong>IE7&nbsp;</strong> does support the .png format properly, so when
that version takes over the user base we may begin employing imaged drop shadows that look
good even when placed against patterns or objects on the screen.
</p>

<p class="tip">
There is one way to make IE6 "support" partially transparent .png's, using a
Microsoft proprietary feature, the <strong>alphaimageloader&nbsp;filter</strong>.
Unfortunately, use of this filter means that it is not really a background anymore,
and so cannot be positioned. Even worse, the filter must be applied to a box that
has <a href="http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html">Layout</a>, and
that would wreck the method in IE6. These and other MS filter problems are covered at
<a href="http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/tmp/alphatransparency.html">Ingo&nbsp;Chao's&nbsp;website</a>.
</p>

<p>
Okay, we merely need to wait a while, and our beautiful .png drop shadows will work
in most browsers, yes? Well, <em>yes and no</em>. The fact is, those two imaged drop shadow
methods we mentioned earlier <em>cannot work with .png images</em>. There's a simple reason,
and it will become clear if you think about shadows "twice" as hard.
</p>

<p>
If you put on sunglasses, the world gets darker, correct? And what happens if you
put on two pairs of sunglasses at the same time? Darker still. Well, the
same thing happens to partially transparent .png's when they are overlaid one atop
another. Basically the alpha transparency of the two .png's are added, making the
result <em>less</em> transparent, hiding twice as much of what is behind them.
</p>

<p class="float-p">
<img class="" width="184px" height="192px" src="images/crossover.png" alt="" />
That's great for the cases where different shadows are supposed to cross over
each other, as in the graphic to the left. This image was taken from our
<a href="sidepages/dropshadow/dropshadow.html">demo&nbsp;page</a>, where the
kitty's shadow crosses the clock's shadow. The arrow indicates the region where
the .png shadows cross, and it's easy to see how the pixels are added together and become
less transparent, producing a darkening effect similar to the way real shadows behave.
</p>

<p>
It isn't so pretty if such darkening occurs within a single drop shadow.
</p>

<p>
Here's the basic problem. The Onion&nbsp;Skin method works by placing a couple
of small "masking" .gifs directly in front of the sharp clipped ends
on the main shadow image. One edge is opaque and the same color as the page background,
while the other edge of that same masking image matches the main drop shadow image, with a
gradient between the pure color edge and the complex shadow edge.
</p>

<p>
The increasingly white portion of the masking image makes the linear main shadow
appear to fade toward white, masking the spot where it would appear clipped, so
you never see that sharp clipped shadow-end. But this means that even if the main
image is a semi-transparent .png, both ends of the composite drop shadow will be
completely opaque, necessarily masking off any pattern on the page background,
and we are using .png to <em>avoid</em> hiding the page background.
</p>

<p>
That's no good, so what if we substitute partially transparent .png's
for both the main and corner background images, what happens then? Remember that they are
fully <em>overlapping</em> each other. You guessed it, the screen area they both
occupy becomes <em>twice as dark as desired</em>, again ruining the drop shadow effect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="method"></a>
So this method <em>cannot</em> be used with the .png format, and that will become a big
problem as IE7 becomes more prevalent and clients get hungry for better drop shadows.
Obviously we need a new method!
</p>

<h2>Introducing the PNG Drop Shadow Method</h2>

<p>
The only way a .png drop shadow can ever work is to avoid any overlaps between the
different images that make up the drop shadow, meaning that they must <em>exactly
touch</em> at all times, but <em>must not overlap</em>. The current methods cannot
do this, so some new tricks must be employed, and CSS is so powerful that it
gives us just the tools we need do it. Let's begin with the basic HTML structure.
</p>

<h3>The Good Old Nested DIV's Again</h3>

<p>
Yes, nested DIV's are again needed, and for the same old reasons, to provide extra
backgrounds and the ability to shift the content box. Some may say that nested DIV's
are no better than the table method, but just try and compare the two code constructions
by eye and you will see a huge difference. The tabled drop shadow approach leaves
cells scattered willy-nilly around the intended content, while nested DIV's keep
all their start and end tags in two tight groups.
</p>

<p>
Besides that, such non-content table cells are very unpleasant for those vision-impared
users who use screen readers. If it helps, imagine that our two groups of DIV
tags are really "supertags," since the start and end tags all occupy the same two spots
in the source, just like simple tags do. Hey, one string of code <em>could</em>
be considered as one "tag", right?
</p>

<p>
Anyway, Let's start with the HTML needed for this method:
</p>

<code>&lt;div class="outerpair1">
&nbsp;&lt;div class="outerpair2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class="shadowbox">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class="innerbox">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img width="400px" height="315px" src="kitty.jpg" alt="" />
&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;/div>
</code>

<p>
<strong>.outerpair1</strong> and <strong>.outerpair2</strong> are mainly used to
hold and display two small .png backgrounds for the sharp corners. In addition,
<strong>.outerpair1</strong> may also receive an optional extra class to provide a width
or extra styling. The <strong>.outerpair2</strong> DIV gets method-essential padding.
The <strong>.shadowbox</strong> DIV holds the main .png drop shadow background, and
<strong>.innerbox</strong> employs relative positioning to shift the content
so that it does not cover the dropshadow.
</p>

<p>
We'll study these elements one at a time along with their related CSS properties.
</p>

<h3>The .outerpair1 DIV</h3>

<p class="float-p">
<img class="" width="317px" height="317px" src="images/shadowset1.png" alt="" />
The <strong>.outerpair1</strong> DIV is the outermost box, and so this element
interacts with the rest of the page elements outside the drop shadow group. As
such, this DIV may be floated or made absolute to enable "shrink-to-fit" around
a sized content element like an image or flash movie, or alternatively .outerpair1
may be directly sized via a CSS width.
</p>

<p>
.outerpair1 is fairly bug free in Explorer, so there is not too much that can go
wrong regarding any CSS applied to the DIV. Be aware that if the DIV group contains
flexible content like text, and is placed inside a column element that is already
width-controlled, there will then be no need set a width on the .outerpair1 DIV.
The column itself will control the width of the drop shadow DIV group. Still,
you may apply margining to .outerpair1 if you wish, further constraining its width
within that width-controlled column element.
</p>

<p>
Besides being the "outside&nbsp;face" of the DIV group, .outerpair1 serves to
display the upper-right-corner background .png that will terminate the right side
of the drop shadow at the top end.
</p>

<h3>The .outerpair2 DIV</h3>

<p class="float-p">
<img class="" width="317px" height="317px" src="images/shadowset2.png" alt="" />
Next comes <strong>.outerpair2</strong>, which displays another small .png in the
lower left corner, terminating the bottom drop shadow at the left end. It's a
shame that both of these background images can't be applied onto just one div,
but elements are restricted to one background each. It's not possible to predict
how far apart the corners will be, and background images cannot be scaled, so
there is no choice but to use two DIV's for this purpose.
</p>

<p>
It is <em>technically</em> possible to combine these two DIV's into one, by using
a method similar to that found in the
<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssdrop2/">CSS&nbsp;Drop&nbsp;Shadows&nbsp;II</a>
article, but then the resulting drop shadow couldn't be placed over patterns or
other objects because there would be opaque ends on the drop shadows. If it were
done with a .png, the end-fades would not be smoothly rounded but would instead be
oddly squared off.
</p>

<p>
<strong>.outerpair2</strong> also supplies a major piece of the method via its
top and left padding, which is
sized to match the thickness of the drop shadow. This padding (outside the dotted
red lines in the graphic) forces any elements nested inside of .outerpair2 to be
8px smaller both horizontally and vertically, and keeps that element down in
the lower right corner of .outerpair2. We have thus prepared a nesting spot for
the next DIV, so let's bring it in.
</p>

<h3>The .shadowbox DIV</h3>

<p class="float-p-r">
<img class="" width="359px" height="354px" src="images/shadowset3.png" alt="" />
<img class="" style="clear: both;" width="317px" height="317px" src="images/shadowset4.png" alt="" />
As you can see, <strong>.shadowbox</strong> (bordered blue in the graphic) has
just one function, to display <em>shadow.png</em> as a background image, positioned
into the lower right corner of the .shadowbox DIV. This DIV occupies the space
delineated by the padding on .outerpair2. The first graphic to the right
shows how the shadow.png image is actually much wider than needed, and extends
beyond the left and top edges of the .shadowbox DIV. That would look terrible
if it were displayed in a browser that way, but luckily it is not.
</p>

<p>
Background images are <em>never</em> allowed to display beyond the edges of their
parent element, and any that do will get clipped off at the parent box edges,
as shown in the 2nd  graphic to the right. The blue bordered .shadowbox is the
parent for this background, so the clipping occurs at the left and top edges of
.shadowbox, <em>exactly where it touches the two other background images</em>.
</p>

<p>
Note that all the colored and black borders in these graphics are for explanatory
purposes only, and the method itself does not need them.
</p>

<p>
So now our shadowed DIV group is nicely falling into place, but we aren't done
quite yet. There is still a need to place an actual content DIV in there, but
where? The obvious location would be a box the same size as .shadowbox and stuffed
into the upper left corner of .outerpair2, but that can't normally happen because any
further nested DIV's must fall inside .shadowbox!
</p>

<p>
Okay, it's true that the .innerbox DIV must go inside the .shadowbox DIV, but it
need <em>not</em> be displayed there, as we shall see.
</p>

<h3>The .innerbox DIV</h3>

<p class="float-p">
<img class="" width="317px" height="317px" src="images/shadowset5.png" alt="" />
<img class="" style="clear: both;" width="317px" height="317px" src="images/shadowset6.png" alt="" />
Let's go ahead and plop <strong>.innerbox</strong> inside .shadowbox, and sure
enough it ends up covering the entire shadow.png background. That's no good,
so to fix it we make .innerbox "relative" and apply negative <strong>left</strong>
and <strong>top</strong> values similar to the paddings on .outerpair2.
</p>

<p>
When such relative shifting occurs to a box, it's as though the box were lifted
bodily from the page and shifted sideways in front of the other page content. After
it comes to rest, it covers up anything that lies behind it. More importantly,
<em>that shifted box does not change its dimensions</em>. So not only does it
go where we want it to, but it's the correct size when it gets there. Perfect!
</p>

<p>
The two graphics to the left reveal how .innerbox is first placed neatly
within .shadowbox, and then is shifted up into the desired location. Now the
drop shadow is starting to look pretty darned good, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
Some may wonder why we haven't used negative margining for this operation, but that
method just doesn't work, for certain complicated CSS reasons. We could try to explain
it, but it really doesn't matter much. Besides, we aren't sure we understand it
ourselves! All we really know for sure is that negative margins don't get the job done.
</p>

<p>
The last step is perfectly obvious, just drop some kind of content into .innerbox
and that content will appear to throw a .png shadow onto any patterns or elements
that are behind it. Woohoo!
</p>

<h3>Important Points</h3>

<img class="float-right" width="370px" height="359px" src="images/shadowset-slant.png" alt="" />
<img class="float-right" width="317px" height="317px" src="images/shadowset7.jpg" alt="" />

<p>
It should be kept in mind that this DIV stack is arranged a bit differently than the
<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/onionskin/">Onion&nbsp;Skin&nbsp;stack</a>,
which has the main shadow background at the back, with the corner backgrounds masking
it off from in front. Our .png method requires that the corner backgrounds be
<em>behind</em> .shadowbox (enclosing .shadowbox), because those DIV's must be
larger than the .shadowbox DIV. It isn't really feasible to have larger elements
inside smaller ones, at least not without great complications.
</p>

<p>
Also, by doing it this way it's easy to pad the .outerpair2 DIV so that the smaller
.shadowbox DIV fits nicely inside, with the three shadow .png's in full contact
but never overlapping. Works for us.
</p>

<p>
It must be made clear that the primary consideration when applying this technique
is that of <em>width</em>. The height will take care of itself, but width matters a lot.
If the content placed within the DIV group has an <strong>intrinsic&nbsp;width</strong>
(as do images, flash movies, Iframes, etc...) or if it's a block element with a
stated width, <em>and</em> .outerpair1 is either floated or made absolute,
.outerpair1 will shrink-to-fit. This means that the outermost DIV will want to shrink
down to the width of that innermost pre-sized content, constraining .outerpair2 and
.shadowbox down as well in the process.  The result is a nice well-formed shadow group.
</p>

<p>
If the content element is widthless, perhaps as a simple paragraph, then the text
in that paragraph will want to "inflate" the paragraph to fill as wide a space
as possible. <em>Positioning or floating on .outerpair1 will not
stop the text from inflating the entire DIV group to the maximum space available.</em>
For this case it is necessary to apply a width to either that content element,
the .innerbox DIV, the .outerpair1 DIV, or an external bounding box such as a
column container.
</p>

<p>
Just remember, a block of text always exerts inflationary width pressure, and float or position-induced
shrink-to-fit behavior loses when it goes head to head with that text inflation pressure. A real assigned
width is needed somewhere, or else the text will expand into any horizontal space available outside the shadow
group, widening the entire group as it goes.
</p>

<h3>Pros and Cons of the Method</h3>

<p>
Let's take a hard look at the PNG Drop Shadow method.
</p>

<dl>

<dt><strong>Pros:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Looks like a real shadow in all situations</li>
<li>Works well on any block element, or inline elements with "intrinsic width"</li>
<li>The DIV tags may be generated via scripting</li>
<li>The DIV tags form two compact groups</li>
<li>All tags are DIV's and so don't interfere with semantic parsing of the document</li>
<li>Fairly low server hit</li>
<li>Can be made to degrade gracefully</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><strong>Cons:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Requires image-making skills</li>
<li>A modified shadow requires new images</li>
<li>Does not work in IE/Mac or &nbsp;IE6</li>
<li>Adds to source clutter for a non-essential visual effect</li>
<li>A very large number of instances on one page may delay processing slightly</li>
</ul>
</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Construction Details and Bug Tips</h3>

<p>
First, it's true that .innerbox could be discarded and its CSS applied to the
image itself. Usually that works fine, but it won't work in IE7 for all cases,
and we wanted to make the method as fool-proof as possible (present company excepted).
</p>

<p>
Be careful when adding inner elements that have top margins, because these will
"escape" from .innerbox and then ram against the top padding on .outerpair2,
forcing a gap in the shadow arrangement. If .innerbox has a width or height,
IE will trap the margin there and will look okay while Firefox will appear broken.
Just add a 1px top padding on .innerbox to insure any internal margins are trapped
there and won't escape to cause damage amongst your shadow group divs.
</p>

<p>
Some very weird background bugs can occur in IE7 for reasons that are still not
entirely clear. One bug seems to double the shadow.png application, causing an
overlap darkening, but often only within "zones" of 150px in height and only along the
right side. We have seen these mysterious IE zones before, and now there is a bit
of <a href="http://css-class.com/test/bugs/ie/renderingbands.htm">light&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;subject</a>.
</p>

<p>
Another set of bugs may occur if .innerbox is replaced by a non-div element like
a paragraph. It just goes buggy, that's all, IE doesn't really need a reason.
By having .innerbox be a DIV, those non-div bugs are avoided.
</p>

<p>
The current construction seems to be immune to the weird IE background bug, but
be warned that tweaking the method could easily resurrect the IE bug. To modify
the method, open the display in IE7 and make changes one at a time, checking
carefully each time in IE7. Otherwise
you could do a lot of beautiful work for Firefox only to be faced with a really
nasty bug that refuses to die. Don't let this happen to you.
</p>

<p class="tip">
A <em>very important point</em> is that <strong>.outerpair2</strong> and
<strong>.shadowbox</strong> must <em>never</em> receive either a
<strong>width</strong> or <strong>height</strong>. The reason is that this would trigger
<a href="http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html">Layout</a>, causing
any .outerpair1 shrink-to-fit to fail in all IE versions. Just try it and see!
Further, any other CSS properties that trigger layout are also to be avoided.
It shouldn't be an issue since those two DIV's are there only to support the
technique and really ought not be messed around with, but mistakes do happen
so be careful.
</p>

<h3>Browser Support</h3>

<p>
As mentioned, IE7 supports the method as does Firefox, Opera, and Safari. IE6 and
IE/Mac will need to have most CSS in the technique hidden from them, and IE/Mac
will have additional trouble in the cases where .outerpair1 is floated or made
absolute for shrink-to-fit purposes. While IE/Win can easily get CSS that displays
a simple unstyled set of nested DIV's, IE/Mac will be problematic in the
shrink-to-fit case without a width on a floated or positioned .outerpair1 DIV.
</p>

<h3>Dumbing Down for Older IE/Win Browsers</h3>

<p>
It so happens that IE7 obeys the <strong>child&nbsp;combinator</strong> ">" while
IE6 and below do not, so any rules you wish to hide from earlier IE/Win versions
need only have this CSS operator in the selector. IE7 will read the rule and can
also handle the .png's that go with it, and IE6 will ignore the entire rule, so
everyone is happy. Examine the source of the
<a href="sidepages/dropshadow/dropshadow.html">demo&nbsp;page</a> for details on
this trick. Alternatively you may use
<a href="haslayout.html">Conditional&nbsp;Comments</a>
to achieve the same effects. It's not very hard to perform the dumb-down itself,
so we'll just give the general theory.
</p>

<p>
Basically the idea is to hide all styling on .outerpair2, .shadowbox, and .innerbox,
along with the background on .outerpair1, from the gaze of IE6 and below. Any widths,
floating, or positioning on .outerpair1 should be shown to all browsers. That's all
there is to it, and the resulting DIV group will act like a single DIV when rendered in IE6.
</p>

<h2>Feedback?</h2>

<p>
This method is very new, and we would be very happy to hear about any problems
you may encounter when using it. Also we want to link to any coders who demo
useful modifications to the method on a stable web page.
