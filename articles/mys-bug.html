<em>We originally wrote this article for the
<a href="http://css-discuss.incutio.com/"><strong>css-d&nbsp;wiki</strong></a>,
the repository of all things CSS that get hashed out on the
<a href="http://www.css-discuss.org/mailman/listinfo/css-d"><strong>css-discuss list</strong></a>.
</em>
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">
<strong>CSS bugs can be obscenely difficult to isolate,</strong> especially when they are located
amidst a large, complex page with many external style sheets. Compounding
this is the fact that few coders have enough experience to be sure that what
they're seeing really IS a bug, and not just incorrect coding.
</p>
<p>
Often people will, when facing the Mystery Bug, just thrash about almost blindly,
and only by pure luck will the answer be found. This need not be.
</p>
<p>
By following the proceedure below, a clear understanding of the problem may be
quickly obtained, freeing the coder to find a workaround or avoid the bug altogether.
</p>

<h3>Step One: Validation</h3>

<p>
Too often this step is not performed, which is a shame because the majority of Mystery Bugs
are simply due to typos and basic code errors. Luckily, online validation tools
(<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">html</a>, <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">css</a>)
are available.
These engines will expose outright validation errors, and will also give validation warnings
about code that might possibly cause viewing problems due to conflicts with user stylesheets
and the like. But beware; they have been known on occasion to throw errors for seemingly
valid code. This is quite rare, though.
</p>

<h3>Step Two: Simplify the Cascade</h3>

<p>
If all the CSS for the page is contained within the source document, or if it is all within a single
external .css file, go on to the next step. Otherwise, it's best to embed the relevant CSS into a
single document.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Make <em>sure</em> you have safe copies of all documents
before you start, not after it's too late.
</p>
<p>
After cutting each external link, save, and view the page. If a link is removed and the bug
disappears, paste that .css file in the link location. If the link is cut and the bug stays, move
on to the next link. In the case of a &lt;link&gt;, the newly embedded CSS must be enclosed with
&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tags. Important: Each external .css file must be placed in the same location
as the link that called for it.
</p>
<p>
When there are no more external sheets, and the bug is still present, it's time for the real work to begin.
</p>

<h3>Step Three: Cut and Paste</h3>

<p>
The object here is to cut large sections of code, save the file, and check to see if the bug is gone
or not. If the bug is gone, paste that section back in, and cut the next section. Obviously, if the
bug is still there, do not paste back that section, but move on to the next. This method is applied
to both the CSS and the HTML. Which one gets done first is up to you.
</p>
<p>
An alternative method is to surround code sections with comment tags. This makes it easier
to recover if you somehow 'lose' the bug, but the source stays cluttered. It's also not as
fast as the first method. Still, some people prefer to comment out blocks of code in a source
to do tests, sources are often shot thru with comments and nesting comments is strictly forbidden!
If you don't know why, give it a try. However, CSS can be used to achieve the same effect
<em>without</em> running afoul of the comment nesting problem.
</p>

<p>
If you want to temporarily remove a block of content and there happens to be a
convenient element wrapper for that block, just add <strong>style="display:&nbsp;none;"</strong>
to the start tag of that element. If there is no such surrounding element to use,
or if it happens to be a crucial strucural element, you can instead add your own
DIV that surrounds the content to be removed and use <strong>style="display:&nbsp;none;"</strong>
on that DIV. In effect such a DIV amounts to a "comment" that may harmlessly
enclose other real HTML comments without any difficulties.
</p>

<p>
The DIV/comment idea is courtesy of
<a href="http://home.tiscali.nl/developerscorner/"><strong>Francky</strong></a>.
Thanks Francky!
</p>

<p>
Be aware of any CSS that is 'inline' within the HTML, and treat these the same as the
embedded CSS. If you cut an inline style rule, and the bug is affected, paste it into the
head within the appropriate rule, and after the other properties in that rule. This should
prevent any alteration of the cascade. Don't forget to view the page, just to be sure.
</p>
<p>
Remember, the goal here is to keep the bug present, while removing or hiding as much of the code
as possible. As you go along, the portions that can be removed will get smaller and smaller.
Switch back and forth between the HTML and CSS, and don't stop until there is <em>not one
single bit of code</em> that can be removed without losing the bug.
</p>

<h3>Step Four: Analysis</h3>

<p>
At this point the bug page is called a 'minimal test case'. You may by now have worked out the
problem and gone bye bye, but if not, step back and take a good long look at the code, and the
page. Here's where code knowledge, analytical skills, and keen observation pay off. You could
'play' with the code, or go to a good knowledge base like the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, or a bit of both. However
it's done, by the time it IS done you will have learned, guaranteed.
</p>
<p>
As a last resort, there's always the
<a href="http://www.css-discuss.org/mailman/listinfo/css-d"><strong>css-discuss list</strong></a>.
Any bug that can survive this treatment
and keep laughing, will draw such as us like sharks to the chum. And not having to paw
thru a huge set of documents is really nice, take our word for it.
</p>

<h3>Fast Strategies</h3>

<p>
Bugs sometimes come along in flurries, and deconstructing each one can be rather
time consuming. Once you have developed some skill in bug hunting you may
prefer to try your luck stalking bugs on a full-scale problem page.
</p>

<p>
Certain techniques are well known. Putting backgrounds or borders on elements to
highlight where they are actually located, and zeroing margins and padding
to reveal the cause of strange gaps. Many issues arise over the incorrect usage of
heights on elements, and weird width issues can be even trickier
to detect.
</p>

<p>
We can't explain such advanced methods in detail because every situation is
different. Just approach each bug with an open mind and don't assume that the most
obvious suspect is necessarily the cause of the bug. Very often your problem will
be the result of obscure parts of the code, working together behind the scenes to
throw up a nasty bug that seems to come from nowhere. These are the toughest bugs to
defeat, and the only possible way you can do so is to be smarter than they are.
As a last resort you may always resort to the minimal test case method, which
will usually expose even the worst deep-cover bugs with ease.
