<h2>Features Of The Jello Mold</h2>

<p>
If you have done a few liquid and rigid CSS layouts, you will be all too aware
of their limitations. A rigid layout is great for maintaining text line lengths
and artistic appearance, but as resolutions keep growing larger these layouts
show embarrassing side spaces more and more.
</p>

<p>
Liquid layouts have their own problems in the wide screens, stretching both text
lines and designs beyond belief in some cases. Besides the obvious, Explorer for Windows
can also have very nasty bugs in liquid layouts when rigid content that shares space
with floats happens to "lock up" the page width. When that happens, the bad old 3px bug
induces content dropping, and the only cure is to use min-width to stop the shrinkage
before lockup happens.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, IE does not support min-width as well as it supports the 3px bug,
so a JavaScript is then needed to coerce compliance in IE. It's a big pain in the
you know where.
</p>

<p class="tip">
<strong>IE7</strong> now supports min-width and max-width and no longer has the
3px bug, woohoo!
</p>

<h3>A New Hope</h3>

<p>
What if it were possible to create a layout that was not fully rigid, nor fully
liquid, but at some selectable point in between? Further, what if this method
also featured a "natural" min-width you could set, without need for scripting?
Is this too much to ask for? Nope, it is now reality, thanks to another of those
young geniuses,
<a href="http://uwmike.com/archive/jello-liquid-layout/"><strong>Mike&nbsp;Purvis</strong></a>.
Trust us folks, minds don't get any more devious than Mike's.
</p>

<p>
The
<a href="sidepages/jello-piefecta-clean.html">Jello Piefecta</a>
has several interesting features that can be seen if you narrow and widen the window.
Yes the center is now liquid, but notice that the outer content edge seems to be
fluid, but if the window is narrow enough it will fill the viewport. If it is
made narrower it generates a horizontal scrollbar similar to a min-width on the
body element.
</p>

<p>
But this effect works in IEwin, and there is no scripting! Now widen out the
window, and while the page also widens, the rate at which it widens is less
than the window. This rate, and the point where min-width stops the narrowing
are both fully controllable.
</p>

<p>
What you are seeing is the Jello Mold, as described by Mike himself
<a href="jello-expo.html">here&nbsp;at&nbsp;PIE</a>, and a superb
invention it is, too. We have taken a <em>new liquid center col version of the Piefecta</em>
and inserted it into the Jello Mold, with spectacular results. Three cols,
source ordered, any col longest, every area tilable, rigid side cols and liquid
center col, and with a nice balance between a rigid and a liquid outer wrapper.
To top it off, a max-width for those who insist that their text lines not be stretched
halfway to Alpha Centauri.
<p>

<p>
It works in <strong>all modern browsers</strong>, except that IEmac does not do
the max-width trick, since it does not support either the CSS rule or the
proprietary MS expression used to cover IEwin. (For a script-free layout, just
omit the max-width expression for IEwin). IE7 natively supports max-width
and does not need this expression. In fact the entire method could be dispensed with
if IE6 were not around, so when it's finally gone you can just use the min-max widths
and a percentage width on a single wrapper and be done with it. Won't that be nice?
</p>

<h3>Bugs</h3>

<p>
In <strong>IEwin</strong>, If any element preceeding the column group has text
(such as the header), and
narrowing the screen causes that text to wrap down to an extra line, it will bump
the col group down as well. This causes IEwin to somehow "forget" the negative
margining on the left column, causing it to cover the center col.
</p>

<p>
Happily any further resizing or refreshing will restore the col margin. This means that
the bug can only be an issue if a user manually narrows the window to the exact critical
header wrap dimension, and not one pixel less. Since this is extremely unlikely,
it's really a non-issue.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Safari</strong> has a strange issue with the negative margins on #expander,
the div that has large negative side margins.
In that browser, if the Jello Mold is loaded into a window that is already narrower
than the natural min-width, #expander is displayed as having <em>no width at all</em>,
resulting in a classic "train&nbsp;wreck". You don't want to know. The answer is
to assign a real min-width equalling the sum of the negative side margins on #expander,
<em>to</em> #expander. End of problem. Kudos to
<strong><a href="http://www.stevenluscherdesign.com/">Steven&nbsp;Luscher</a></strong> for
discovering the bug and helping to test out the fix.
</p>

<p>
There is an <strong>IEmac bug</strong> in designs that use negative margined columns
that makes the left col links vanish on hover. This bug can be killed via
a:hover&nbsp;{position:relative;}, <em>applied only on hover</em>. The IEmac fix
is courtesy of
<a href="http://la.di.da.free.fr/"><strong>Emmanuel&nbsp;Delaborde</strong></a>.
</p>

<h3>Rounding Errors</h3>

<p>
The right col 1px rounding errors are an inherent problem with Gecko (now totally suppressed
in Firefox&nbsp;3, yay!), which is perhaps a bit <em>too</em> strict when  calculating the
rendered dimensions of percentage defined elements. You can see the errors in the right col
and also on the right side of the center col, but only at some window widths. Other browsers
have rounding errors too, but not in this layout.
</p>

<p>
Aditionally, it's possible for the bottom border on the wrapper to lose 1px of width,
altho this does not always happen.
See our <a href="../round-error.html">Rounding Errors</a> demo for more info.
</p>

<p>
If you do not try to use visible elements that span the full width of this col or
touch the right edge of the center col, the errors will pass unnoticed, as with this paragraph.
