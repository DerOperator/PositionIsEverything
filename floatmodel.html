<h2>Float model? What's that?</h2>
<p>
Okay, here is a simple test concerning how static elements interact with floats. According to the W3C specifications,
when a floated element is directly followed by a static element (one that is normally flowed), then first,
the float will be displayed against the left edge of the containing element (in this case the 'body' element),
and then the static element will also display against that same edge, and at the same vertical height as 
the float. 
</p>
<p>
The float should overlay the static element, unless the static element has a left margin that
moves it out to the right, and out from behind the float. The static element might also be 'cleared' 
(clear:left or clear:both), which would put it below the level of the float.
</p>
<h2>Details of the test</h2>
<p>
The green bordered box (div#left) is floated left in the 'body', and is followed by div#static (purple box).
If div#static had no width, then all modern browsers would display correctly, with the purple box 
overlaid by the green bordered box.
</p>
<p>
But, because div#static is <span>width defined</span>, browser variance is fully evident. 
That 'width' declaration makes <span>Internet&nbsp;Explorer</span> put div#static
alongside the float as tho the float were part of the left body edge.
<span>Moz/N7</span> and <span>Op6/7.1</span> do it according
to the specs, with both boxes firmly pinned to the left body edge.
</p>
<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>
Making sophisticated use of float layouts sometimes requires stating the 'widths' on some boxes, but
doing so to a static box that follows a float makes IE display differently than any browser that dares
to adhere to the standards. So differently in fact, as to make the situation impossible to ignore. (unless one
happens to be *you&nbsp;know&nbsp;who*)
</p>
<p>
So the choice is to code only for IE, knowing the minority browsers will break, or avoid using the 'width'
declaration in many cases, putting many types of layouts 'off&nbsp;limits'. Some choice.
</p>
<h2>IE6 is not IE5.5</h2>
<p>
The demo you see here is fully pixel defined, but usually a layout has the widths in percentages, at least for the
elements following the float. When div#static is given a percentage width, IE5.5 looks at the available horizontal space 
alongside the float and says "That is now defined as 100% of the width". So if div#static gets 'width: 50%;', that div is 
half as wide as the space next to the float and starts next to the float as mentioned. 
</p>
<p>
However, IE6 is different. Yes IE6 does start the div next to the float, but it does <em>not</em> take the float 
into consideration when figuring the width of div#static. Rather it uses the entire container as the 100% width
refrence, just as the specs require. Yet it <em>does</em> start the div alongside the float! So the problem is only
half-fixed in IE6, creating one more headache for us poor coders. 
</p>
<p>
What does this mean? Well, if the div is given a width of 100%, it is as wide as the body element, and being placed 
next to the float it forces the right edge of the body element sideways by the width of the float, causing a scrollbar. 
<em>But only in IE6!</em> As if this mess weren't already bad enough. Oy.
</p>
<h2>Close call in Norway</h2>
<p>
There was recently a disturbing turn of events. <span>Opera7</span>, (released Jan-2003) 
was doing just what IE does; 
putting div#static next to the float, rather than having div#static ignore the
float and start at the left viewport edge, as was done in Op6.
</p>
<p>
This seemed to be a 'cave-in' on the part of the Opera decision makers, to take the 'easy path', rather
than stick to the specifications. Microsoft is indeed very influential, and apparently the float
specifications were fast becoming a dead letter.
</p>
<p>
Happily Opera 7.1 (released April-2003) properly obeys the float specification. Whew! 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Last thoughts</h2>
<p> 
I am no purist, and could happily live with a specification designed by Microsoft, but to have MS
publicly support the specs while silently flouting them really burns my toast. Is this how the future is made?
</p>
<p>
It's past time that these issues were aired out. Gentle reader, if you know any way of 'getting to' the
movers and shakers at Microsoft, won't you please try and shake loose some kind of information 
regarding future plans? I dread having to tell the next newbie that the simple, straightfoward 
CSS standards can't simply be used 'as is', because the majority browser maker refuses to 
conform as it supposedly has agreed to do. This situation has got to end sometime; why can't it be now?
