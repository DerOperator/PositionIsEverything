<h4>This bug is only in IE6 and below. IE7 does not show the bug.</h4>

<p>
Please look closely at the test box to the left. Observe how the text at the top does not quite
touch the blue bordered float on the left. The text should touch the float, but instead it seems to
have a 3px padding, keeping it away from the float.
</p>
<p>
Now see how in the black bordered paragraph the 3px space is still there. The left edge of the
paragraph is way over on the left edge of the test box (behind the float),
but the space is still evident. This implies that
the space is connected to something in the &lt;p&gt;, not the &lt;p&gt; itself.
</p>
<h4>
But just what is in the &lt;p&gt;?
</h4>
<p>
Only text, which also means 'line boxes'; invisible 'anonymous' boxes that
contain inline text, images, and anything else that is declared 'inline'.
</p>
<p>
So apparently IE is adding 3px of space to the end of the line boxes in this demo if they touch the float. Now cast your
eyes down to the bottom of the test box. Observe how the 3px space is evident even tho the red bordered
box (#jog-box) is left margined far enough to separate it from the float. This means that the added 'space'
is applied to the line boxes that are adjacent to a float, not just to ones that are touching the float.
</p>
<p class="tip">
Be aware that the paragraphs' left margin extends <em>behind</em> the float, reaching all the way
to the left side of the brown container box, just as with the black bordered paragraph in the demo.
To make that gap between the float and the red paragraph, the left paragraph margin must be larger
than the width of the float.
</p>
<h4>
Here's the tricky part
</h4>
<p>
Observe how the 3px space abruptly ends at the same vertical height that the float also ends. (!)
It's now clear that the float is causing the 3px space to be added to the line boxes. In fact, if the blue box
were floated to the right, the space would be appended to the right end of the line boxes.
</p>
<p>
The close-up image at the lower left shows the 'text-jog' that results when the float is passed by.
 It is this 'jog' that is the main problem, causing a small but irritating
blemish on otherwise flawless layouts.
</p>
<p class="tip">
Another problem may occur in tightly fitting layouts when the 3px space is added. Say you have a float
followed by a div holding a large image. Both the float and the div are in a container, and the width of
the div combined with the side margin on the div equals the container width.
<br /><br />
When the adjacent float induces the 3px space on the one big line box inside the div (the one holding that image), the
div can no longer fit in the container! That's because there is 3px of new width on the div, but IE has already determined
box widths, and refuses to go back and redo it. So what
happens is that the div does not display <em>until it is below the vertical level of the float.</em> There, the
3px does not get applied, and the now properly sized div fits just fine, especially with no float to sit next to the div.
<br /><br />
Without knowledge of the 3px space, solving this misalignment can be nearly impossible.
</p>

</p>
<h4>Finding Fixes</h4>
<p>
Up until late 2003 coders who noticed the jog had serious difficulties dealing with it. Eventually it became
clear that applying a dimension to the paragraph, either 'width' or 'height', prevents IE/win from adding
the 3px space.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this dimension also throws IE into its proprietary
<a href="../floatmodel.html"><strong>float&nbsp;model</strong></a>. In effect, when the dimension is applied
the paragraph seems to act much like a float, displaying <em>next</em> to the real float, rather than
letting the float drape across it as the specs require.
</p>
<p>
Normally this behavior must be avoided to keep all the browsers in agreement, but thru  it
can actually be employed to kill the 3px jog while not leading to variance.
</p>

<h4></h4>

<h4>Details</h4>
<p>
Remember, only IE/win is allowed to see this, and in addition, IE is prevented from applying the left margin on the
paragraph. That left paragraph margin is normally allowed to run behind the float (as it should), but
the paragraph box itself is kept from doing the same (in IE) just because it has that dimension (very wrong).
As if that were not enough, the paragraph margin seems to get 3px added to it by IE, so if the margin is as wide
or wider than the float, this 3px variance will make IE have a wider gap between the float and the
paragraph.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Special Note:</strong> This fix should be used on a wrapper element enclosing all content
following the float, not on individual elements. By applying the fix on just one big element the hack
stays simple and possible problems are avoided.
</p>

<p>
Rather than deal with this madness, just apply desired horizontal space between the two elements
by using a right margin on the float instead of the left margin on the paragraph. Here's how it might
look in code:
</p>
<code>
#floatbox {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;float: left;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 100px;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
&nbsp;<br />
p {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-left: 110px;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
&nbsp;<br />
/* Hide from IE5-mac. Only IE-win sees this. \*/<br />
&nbsp;<br />
* html #floatbox {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: 10px;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
&nbsp;<br />
* html p {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 1%;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-left: 0;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
&nbsp;<br />
/* End hide from IE5/mac */<br />
</code>
<p>
Two more things. When the IE float model is invoked, the float suddenly has a 3px margin on the
paragraph side, which at least can be killed within the Tan hack either by a negative 3px margin, or
by reducing the existing float margin by 3px.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, as mentioned before, IE5/mac must be kept from seeing the hacks,
so the hacks are wrapped in the Mac-hack (uses comments). See this
<a href="../sidepages/jogfix.html"><strong>live demo</strong></a> for a working example
of this method, and check out the source for tips.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Special Note:</strong> If the float is an <em>image</em> (or presumably, other generated content),
then the 3px line box space is NOT applied by IE. Sadly, IE5.x/win does not leave it at that, but in the event
of a floated image, a proprietary 3px margin is applied to both the left and right sides of the image. Since IE6
does not do this, we have yet another cross-Explorer variation. Just what we need.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the 3px line box space, these unfortunate margins can be hacked away by use of the Tan hack, thus:
</p>
<code>
* html #floated-image {<br />
margin: 0 -3px; ma\rgin: 0;<br />
}
</code>
<p class="tip">
Using '* html' before the target element keeps all but IE from recognizing it as a real selector.
IE thinks there is a wrapper element surrounding 'html' and so does obey all rules within this block.
The second 'ma\rgin' is ignored by IE5.x/win, so IE6 and IE5/mac get the non-hacked margin values.

</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
IE is still a big headache, but I personally thought this problem would never be solved.
Glad to see that not all is lost.

This box is margined on the left, the width of the float and more, to keep it separate from the float.
Still, the space continues, until.. hey! Where'd it git to?! Well, it appears that: no adjacent float, no 3px space.
