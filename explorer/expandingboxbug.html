<h1>Internet Explorer 6 and the Expanding Box Problem </h1>

<p style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;">
A Guest Demo, courtesy of <a href="http://www.blissfulwebdesign.com/">BlissfulWebDesign</a>
</p>

<p>
It's an unfortunate fact that <strong>Internet Explorer 6</strong> will always
incorrectly expand any dimensionally restricted
block element so that oversize content is unable to overflow, as the specs
require that content to do. <strong>IE7</strong> has fixed this issue
and does not wrongly expand boxes such boxes, instead allowing the overflow property
to operate as intended by the W3C.
</p>

<p>
I will be comparing <strong>IE6's</strong>
way with the correct behavior as seen in <strong>Firefox</strong>.
The W3C says a rigidly sized block box should allow oversize
content to protrude or overflow beyond the edges of the sized box.
</p>

<p>
There is no real "fix" for IE6's incorrect behavior, except to work around or avoid it.
Several possible workarounds will be detailed as I discuss the issue.
</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Problem </h2>

<p>Have you ever tried to do a two-column float layout like in the graphic below?</p>
<p><img src="images/pict1.gif" width="401" height="108"></p>
<p>And after some content changes, it turns out like this when viewed in IE6? </p>
<p><img src="images/pict2.gif" width="412" height="218"><br>
  <span class="note">Screen shot in IE6 </span></p>
<p>It's a "float drop", and it's caused by having oversized content in a
fixed-width floated div that must fit into a particular spot in the layout.
In this case, the oversized content is the URL string in the green float.</p>
<p>To understand what is happening, first consider our HTML structure:</p>
<p class="samplecode">&lt;div id=&quot;wrap&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div id=&quot;masthead&quot;&gt;My header&lt;/div&gt;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div id=&quot;leftnav&quot;&gt;Typical Left Nav&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div id=&quot;main&quot;&gt;My main text here...&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div id=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;My footer&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;/div&gt; </p>

<p>This is a common  two-column structure, where we have a
<STRONG>&lt;div&nbsp;id="masthead"&gt;</STRONG> (colored&nbsp;blue), followed by
two floated columns: <STRONG>&lt;div&nbsp;id="leftnav"&gt;</STRONG>
(colored&nbsp;green) and <STRONG>&lt;div&nbsp;id="main"&gt;</STRONG>
(colored&nbsp;red). The two columns are made to sit side-by-side because they
both get the CSS <strong>float:&nbsp;left;</strong>.
</p>

<p class="samplecode">
  #masthead {background-color: #006699;}<br>
  #leftnav {background-color: #99CC00; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="hilite">float: left;</strong> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 50px; }<br>
    #main { background-color: #D54500;<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="hilite">float: left;</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 340px; }<br>
    #footer {
    background-color: #CCCCCC;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="hilite">clear: both;</strong>}</p>

<p>Finally we have the <strong>&lt;div&nbsp;id=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;</strong>

(colored dark gray) where we <strong>clear</strong> the float&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;forcing the
footer to clear itself to a position below the earlier floated columns.</p>

<p>All the page elements are enclosed in a wrapper div:
<strong>&lt;div&nbsp;id=&quot;wrap&quot;&gt;</strong>. This wrapper is set to a width
of <strong>390px</strong>, enforcing a rigid pixel with on the layout. </p>

<p class="samplecode">#wrap {<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="hilite">width: 390px;</strong><br>
}

</p>


<p>We want our green left column to take up exactly <strong>50px</strong> of the
available wrapper width, and the main column will occupy the remaining
<strong>340px</strong>, so we have specifically set these widths
in the CSS:</p>
<p class="samplecode">#leftnav {background-color: #99CC00; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float: left; <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="hilite">width: 50px;</strong> }<br>
#main { background-color: #D54500;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float: left;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="hilite">width: 340px;</strong> }
</p>

<p>And if you look at the code in both Firefox and IE6, things looks as expected. </p>

<p><img src="images/pict1.gif" width="401" height="108"><br>
  <span class="note">Screen shot in Firefox and IE6 </span></p>

<p>
So far so good, but real web pages are messy, and sometimes they receive content
that the designer did not test in advance. When that happens, suprising things can
happen.
</p>

<h2>The Cause Of The Problem </h2>

<p>One common cause of box expansion in IE6 is when you have oversized content
such as a long "unbreakable" URL, with no spaces where word wrapping may take place.
What if our <strong>&lt;div&nbsp;id=&quot;leftnav&quot;&gt;</strong> consists of this content:</p>

<p class="samplecode">&lt;div id=&quot;leftnav&quot;><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="hilite">http://AnUnbreakableURL.com</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Left Nav<br>
  &lt;/div&gt;
</p>

<p><a href="sidepages/demo2.htm">view live code</a>  <br>

  <span class="note">View live demo in IE6 to see incorrect behavior.
	View in Firefox for correct behavior.</span></p>

<p>The graphic below shows what you will see if you view it in IE6:</p>

<p><img src="images/pict2.gif" width="412" height="218"><br>
  <span class="note">Screen shot in IE</span></p>

<p>Note how IE6 has expanded the width of <EM><STRONG>div#leftnav</STRONG></EM>
(green&nbsp;box) to accommodate the unbreakable URL string. <EM><STRONG>div#leftnav</STRONG></EM>

is no longer 50px wide, as specified by its given CSS width value. After this expansion,
<em><strong>div#main</strong></em> (red box) does not have room to fit
inside our fixed-width layout next to <EM><STRONG>div#leftnav</STRONG></EM>,
and is forced to go below. Since we did not specify an
<A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visufx.html#overflow">overflow</A>
property value for <EM><STRONG>div#leftnav</STRONG></EM>, its overflow property
value defaults to <STRONG>visible</STRONG>. The expansion of
<em><strong>div#leftnav</strong></em> is a clear violation of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visufx.html#overflow">W3C&nbsp;specification</a>

for the <strong>overflow</strong> property, which covers the default value
"visible" this way:
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Visible</strong> (the default or "initial" value for the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visufx.html#propdef-overflow">overflow&nbsp;property</a>
)<br />
"This value indicates that content is not clipped, i.e.,<br />

it may be rendered outside the block box".
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that it does <em>not</em> say that the box should be enlarged when content is too big to fit.
IE6 should respect the assigned width, and should <EM>not expand the div</EM>.
The URL should be allowed to overflow outside the green box.</p>

<p>
Notice how the text "Left" and "Nav" are on separate lines? Why don't they just
appear on one single line, since the green box is clearly wide enough to hold them?
That is because IE6 seems to <em>not know when it has expanded a box!</em>
</p>

<p>I will demonstrate with an oversized image followed by a paragraph, both inside
the green #leftnav box:</p>

<p class="samplecode"> &lt;div id=&quot;masthead&quot;&gt;My header&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;div id=&quot;leftnav&quot;&gt;<br>
  <strong class="hilite">&lt;img src=&quot;masthead.jpg&quot; width=&quot;267&quot; height=&quot;50&quot;&gt;<br>

  &lt;p>An image followed by a paragraph of text&lt;/p&gt;</strong><br>
&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;div id=&quot;main&quot;&gt;My main text here. ... &lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;div id=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;My footer&lt;/div&gt; </p>

<p><img src="images/pict15.gif" width="392" height="261"><br>
  <span class="note">Screen shot in IE6</span></p>
<p><a href="sidepages/demo10.htm">view live code</a> </p>

<p>The paragraph following the image is colored a darker shade of green so that
you can see what is going on. </p>

<p>Note how the image has expanded the lighter green <strong>#leftnav</strong> div in IE6.
However, nested block elements (such as our paragraph) do <em>not</em> expand to fill the
newly available area in the expanded container div! You would think that the dark green
paragraph would fill the entire width of its light green container as usual, but it
doesn't. Apparently the paragraph does not "know" that the light green container
has been expanded by the large image in the same container, so the paragraph
below stays the same width and doesn't expand to fill the available space.
</p>

<p>
This effect can cause coders to think the problem is in the paragraph, when really
it's the image and container that are causing the IE6 problem. Suspicious right
side spaces like this should be a warning that expansion has occured somewhere.
</p>

<h2>The Way It's Supposed To Be</h2>

<p>Now let's look at that "long URL" layout code in Firefox.</p>

<p><a href="sidepages/demo2.htm">view live code</a> <br>
  <span class="note">View in Firefox (shown below) to see correct behavior. View in IE6 for incorrect behavior.</span></p>

<p><img src="images/pict3.gif" width="392" height="102"><br>
  <span class="note">Screen shot in Firefox </span></p>

<p>Firefox respects the specified width on the paragraph, but what has happened
to the text? Is it clipped,
in violation of the specs? Not to worry, the text actually does overflow correctly.
We just cannot see it because the red background on the adjacent red float is covering
it up. Let's remove the background from <strong>div#main</strong> and see if it's
hiding back there. </p>
<p class="samplecode">#main {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;float: left;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 340px;<br>
&nbsp;/* background removed */<br>
}</p>

<p><a href="sidepages/demo3.htm">view live code</a> </p>

<p><img src="images/pict4.gif" width="392" height="102"><br>
  <span class="note">Screen shot in Firefox showing correct overflow</span></p>

<p>Clearly Firefox does exactly what the specification requires, letting the long
URL go beyond the edge of the surrounding green box.
This does cause that URL to go behind the text in the red box, but at least the
floated layout structure is not damaged. Float dropping in such cases is a lot
more harmful to a web page than text overlapping, in the opinion of most people.</p>

<h2>Some Possible Workarounds </h2>

<p>
  Let's examine some workarounds that might keep IE6 from wrecking our layout.</p>

<h3>Using "word-wrap: break-word" </h3>
<p>Try adding the <strong>word-wrap</strong> property with the value <strong>break-word</strong>.</p>
<p class="samplecode">#leftnav {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #99CC00;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;float: left;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 50px;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="hilite">word-wrap: break-word;</strong><br>
}</p>

<p><a href="sidepages/demo4.htm">view live code</a> </p>

<p><img src="images/pict6.gif" width="392" height="173"><br>
    <span class="note">Screen shot in IE6 </span></p>


<p>Although this has no effect on Firefox, it does force IE6 to break up
&quot;unbreakable&quot; text so that it no longer expands the width of the box
containing the text.</p>

<p>
Be aware that word-wrap is a <strong>proprietary Microsoft CSS rule</strong>.
It is not part of the W3C specification at this time, and will invalidate the
page unless that code is hidden inside a
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/overview/ccomment_ovw.asp">Conditional&nbsp;Comment</a>,
like this:
</p>

<p class="samplecode">

&lt;!--[if IE]><br>
&nbsp;&lt;style type="text/css"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;body {word-wrap: break-word;}<br>
&nbsp;&lt;/style><br>
&lt;![endif]--><br>
</p>

<p>
That style block is contained in the CC, which can go in the head section of the web
page. Only IE6 will look inside the CC, while all other browsers and the W3C validator see
only an ordinary HTML comment, and ignore everything inside. It's not a pure solution, but it does
work safely on potientially damaging long text strings, and does validate too.
Notice that <strong>this rule inherits to
all page elements from the body element</strong>, providing page-wide protection.
</p>

<h3>Using overflow: hidden</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visufx.html#overflow">spec</a>,
another possible value for the overflow property is <strong>hidden</strong>.
Let's see what happens when we apply it.
</p>

<p class="samplecode">#leftnav {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #99CC00;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;float: left;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 50px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="hilite">overflow: hidden;</strong><br>
}</p>
<p><a href="sidepages/demo5.htm">view live code</a> </p>
<p><img src="images/pict5.gif" width="392" height="102"><br>
    <span class="note">Screen shot in Firefox and IE6 </span></p>

<p>The overflowed text is hidden, or clipped.  By doing so, IE6 no longer "needs"
to expand the column width. That's good, but some content can never be seen now, and some
browsers have been known to show odd bugs when overflow is changed from the
default value "visible" for complex CSS layouts, so this fix is less than ideal.</p>

<p>
Another drawback of the "hidden" method is that IE6 demands that the boxes
having this overflow fix <em>must have widths applied to them</em>. So for example,
consider a nested paragraph in one of those floated columns above. The floats do have
widths but the nested paragraph will normally be left widthless. If the
<strong>overflow:&nbsp;hidden;</strong> trick is used on the paragraph, it will
fail in IE6. But, if it's used on the surrounding float it will then work properly,
because <em>the element with the overflow rule also has a width applied to it</em>.
</p>

<h2>More Oversized Content</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that oversized content does not only mean very long URLs. You might
also have an image that is too big for the width allowed for it in the container.
Below is a demo graphic
showing an image that's just a bit too wide to let the red box fit next to it:</p>

<p><img src="images/pict7.gif" width="392" height="172"></p>

<p>Or a user might enlarge the browser text size, making a normal word too wide to
fit, just like the long URL:</p>

<p><img src="images/pict8.gif" width="392" height="209"></p>

<p>
<strong>Word-wrap</strong> only works on text, not on images, but both these
problems can be handled by <strong>overflow: hidden</strong> as you can see here. </p>

<p><img src="images/pict9.gif" width="392" height="115"></p>

<p><img src="images/pict10.gif" width="392" height="140"> </p>

<p>
So <strong>overflow: hidden</strong> can protect against oversize text, images,
and even oversize tables, but may clip off some content. Using <strong>word-wrap</strong>
preserves the text but doesn't affect oversize images or tables. As always, web
design means making hard choices.
</p>

<h2>Expansion in the Vertical Direction </h2>

<p>Just as IE6 can incorrectly expand an element's width, it can also incorrectly expand an element's height.
Take the following example where we have <STRONG>&lt;div&nbsp;id="cornerbox"&gt;</STRONG>
inside <STRONG>&lt;div&nbsp;id="masthead"&gt;</STRONG>. </p>

<a href="sidepages/demo7.htm">view live code</a>
</p>
<p>
<span class="note">HTML:</span></p>

<p class="samplecode">
&lt;div id=&quot;masthead&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div id=&quot;cornerbox&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorem ipsum dolor ...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>
<span class="note">CSS:</span></p>

<p class="samplecode">#cornerbox {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 150px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="hilite">height: 50px;</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #99CC00;<br>
}</p>

<p>We now specify the height of the green <strong>div#cornerbox</strong> to be 50px.
Since our text is too tall to be accomodated within this height, the text should
overflow the green box. The correct behavior looks like the following graphic,
as shown in <STRONG>Firefox</STRONG>. Similarly, all other modern non-IE6 browsers such as

<STRONG>Opera</STRONG> and <STRONG>Safari</STRONG> will behave in the same manner.</p>

<p><img src="images/pict11.gif" width="504" height="181"></p>

<p>However, when we take a look at this same code in IE6, it looks like the following: </p>

<p><img src="images/pict12.gif" width="472" height="220"></p>

<p>
IE6 has incorrectly expanded the height of the green div#cornerbox to accommodate
the excess text, and that in turn has expanded the height of the blue div#masthead!
Neither div remains at the 50px height specified on #cornerbox after IE6 gets
a look at that tall text. Both expansions are incorrect behavior, and are violations of the
overflow specification.</p>

<p>
Unlike <strong>IE6</strong>, the <strong>IE/mac</strong> browser will <EM>not</EM>
expand the green corner div (good), but it <EM>will</EM> for
some reason incorrectly expand the blue masthead anyway! (not good)
</p>

<p>
This kind of inconsistency can play havoc with height controlled layouts.
Suppose that you have a background image attached to your masthead and the image
is only 50px high. After expansion you won't have enough image to fill the expanded
masthead.</p>

<p><img src="images/pict13.gif" width="414" height="180"></p>

<p>Non-IE6 browsers will overlap some content, yes, but having two
different apparent problems is very hard on newbies when trying to debug a design
across browsers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 150px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 50px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #99CC00;<br>
  }</p>

<p>Using <strong>word-wrap: break-word</strong> won't help us here. However, we
can set the overflow property to <strong>hidden</strong> to put our
layout back in place. </p>

<p class="samplecode">#cornerbox {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 150px;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 50px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #99CC00;<br>

<p><img src="images/pict14.gif" width="408" height="89"><br>

  <span class="note">Screen shot in IE6 and Firefox </span></p>

<p>Now IE6 no longer expands the element. And best of all, it behaves
consistently between both IE6 and Firefox.
</p>

<p>
Clearly there are options available, but the best and most common option employed
for web pages is to <em>not use height at all</em>. Letting height be the default <strong>auto</strong>
will let content determine the height and avoid the IE box expansion problem. Unless
the content's displayed height can be rigidly controlled, applying a height to the container
box will only cause trouble.
</p>

<h2>Summary </h2>

<p>In summary, both <strong>word-wrap: break-word</strong> and
<strong>overflow: hidden</strong> are possible workarounds that will make
Internet Explorer respect our specified dimensions. The method of
<strong>overflow: hidden</strong> works in more situations -- such as oversized
images and vertical expansions, but at the cost of possibly clipped content.
The <strong>word-wrap:&nbsp;break-word;</strong> method won't clip content,
but is useless on anything but text. Now that you have seen the effects of both,
their possible employment will depend on specific situations and preferences.</p>

<strong>artcoder says: </strong> "I call myself artcoder because I like turning
art into code.  Trained
with a master's degree in computer science, I started out my career as a
programmer working for large corporations, small companies, and
dot-com's.  After years of manipulating lines and lines of abstract
code, I found beauty in art and web design.  Re-tooling myself in the
skills of Photoshop, Fireworks, XHTML, CSS, and color theory, I make my
attempts at web design.  Now I would like to say that I lead a balanced
life with one foot in the world of art and another foot in the world of
code."
