    	<h2>What is it?</h2>

		<p>
		   It&rsquo;s another IE bug which is caused by placing a list with a background
		   set within a floated &lt;div&gt; that has been relatively positioned. (IE doesn't mind if you set a background
		   image, a color, or even both; they'll all disappear.) When these conditions are in place
		   IE will display the background incorrectly. With me so far? Here are a couple of screen
		   shots which should make it clearer:
		</p>


		<p id="cap1">
		<img src="images/ieScreen1.gif" class="left" alt="Disappearing List Backgrounds (dl)" />
		   This is how IE renders a &lt;dl&gt; with a background set on the
		   &lt;dt&gt;. None too impressive huh? I know, but what do you expect;
		   this is IE we&rsquo;re dealing with here!
		</p>

<div id="scrCde1">

		<h3>Screen 1 Code</h3>

		<pre>
			<code>
      div {
         float: left;
         position: relative;
         width: 150px;
         background: #fffdd5;
         border: 1px solid #000;  }

      dt {
         background: red;  }
			</code>
		</pre>

</div>

		<p id="cap2">
		<img src="images/ieScreen2.gif" class="right" alt="Disappearing List Backgrounds (ul)" />
		   This is how IE renders a &lt;ul&gt; with a background
		   set on the &lt;li&gt;. On the first &lt;ul&gt; no backgrounds
		   show, but on the second &lt;ul&gt; they <em>do</em> display.
		   The same thing happens with ordered lists.
		</p>

<div id="scrCde2">

		<h3>Screen 2 Code</h3>

		<pre>
			<code>
        div {
           float: left;
           position: relative;
           width: 150px;
           background: #fffdd5;
           border: 1px solid #000;  }

        li {
           background: red;  }
			</code>
		</pre>

</div>

		<p style="clear: both;">
		   Just in case those screen shots weren't enough for you, here's an actual
		   working example of this heinous bug side by side with a list displayed the
		   way the <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> intended!
		</p>

<div id="bug">

		<dl>
		  <dt>Where's my border?</dt>
			<dd>Definition 1</dd>
			<dd>Definition 2</dd>
		  <dt>Some Other Term</dt>
			<dd>Definition 1</dd>
			<dd>Definition 2</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>
		This is the bug in action. Notice that while the second &lt;dt&gt; has a background, the first has no background.
		</p>

</div>

<div id="working">

		<dl>
		  <dt>Check out my border!</dt>
			<dd>Definition 1</dd>
			<dd>Definition 2</dd>
		  <dt>Some Other Term</dt>
			<dd>Definition 1</dd>
			<dd>Definition 2</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>
		Here is the same code with a fix applied. All backgrounds present and correct! (read on for the fix)
		</p>

</div>

		<p style="clear: left;">
		   Now obviously this bug is fairly uncommon, it&rsquo;s not often you float a &lt;div&gt; <em>and</em> relatively
		   position it. But saying that there are times when doing so comes in useful, mainly when absolutely positioning elements
		   and for fixing other IE bugs... Okay, maybe it <em>is</em> common after all!
		</p>

		<p>
		   This bug gets even stranger than in the examples above, much stranger! For instance; the order the lists
		   are placed and what type of lists they are affect the way the backgrounds display. Place a &lt;dl&gt; after
		   a &lt;ul&gt; and it's backgrounds <em>will display,</em> but when placed before; only the first &lt;dt&gt; will
		   display. If a background is set on &lt;dd&gt; then they will always be displayed, go figure.
		</p>

		<p>
		   Some other strange effects this bug produces are scroll and window painting. This is where the act
		   of scrolling or moving a window over a color background will &quot;paint&quot; it. I've made a simple
		   <a name="painted" id="painted" title="Scroll/Window Painting Mini-demo" href="sidepages/painting.html">scroll/window painting example</a> for you to peruse.
	         (I used a little JavaScript to open up an alert box, so if you have that disabled just open up a new window yourself and use that).
		</p>

		<p>
		   Note that either a background image or a background color can be "painted" by window dragging, so this is
		   consistent with the list background problem.
		</p>

	<h2>How Do I Fix It?</h2>

		<p>
		   The good news is that this little bug is a cinch to eradicate. Just place
		   the following code in your  stylesheet and you'll never have to suffer through
		   the indignity of disappearing list backgrounds again!
		</p>

          <pre id="mainCure">
            <code>
          ul, ol, dl {
              position: relative;  }
            </code>
          </pre>

		<p>
		   Another way is to wrap the effected lists in a relatively positioned &lt;div&gt;,
		   but as this adds extra, un semantic mark-up, it's best to just use the
		   first method, which I've patented as the &quot;1 point Smith manoeuvre&quot;.
		</p>

		<p>
		   Some other <em>less than perfect</em> ways to defeat this bug, listed mainly for informational purposes:
		</p>

			<ol>
			  <li>Float the list itself</li>
			  <li>Declare <code>display: inline;</code> on the list. (Works on &lt;dl&gt;s)</li>
			  <li>Declare any dimension on the lists, or apply the
        <a href="../articles/haslayout.html"><strong>Zoom&nbsp;Fix</strong></a>.</li>
			  <li>Placing a comment tag before the first disappearing element will fix it but subsequent lists will still have problems.</li>
			</ol>

	<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

		<p>
		   This is a really strange and annoying bug to deal with. It took me a
		   while to figure out just what the heck was going on and how to solve
		   it. The biggest problem with this bug is just how variable it can be. The
		   order in which the lists and other elements are placed have small but
		   noticeable effects on the way they're displayed.
		</p>

		<p>
		   But despite this bug's variability, it's easily remedied, just declare&nbsp;
		<strong><code>position:&nbsp;relative;</code></strong>
		 on all effected lists and you're good to go!
